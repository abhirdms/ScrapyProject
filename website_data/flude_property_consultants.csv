The Site forms part of the wider Shopwyke Lakes development and occupies a central location within it. It is conveniently positioned just off the A27, with the historic city centre of Chichester, the Sussex coast, and the South Downs within easy reach. Access to the Site is via Longacres Way, a link road connecting the B2144 to the A27 - the main trunk road along the South Coast, providing direct routes to Southampton, Portsmouth and Brighton. Chichester Railway Station is situated approximately 2 miles to the west and offers direct services to London Victoria twice per house, with fastest journey times of circa 1 hour 35minutes. Southampton Airport is approximately 34 miles to the west and Gatwick Airport iscirca 43 miles to the north east, both offering a wide range of domestic and international connections. Description: Final 1.45 acre fully-serviced development plot for sale at Shopwyke Lakes. Suitable for Residential, Care, and Retirement Accommodation. Accommodation: The site extends to approximately 1.453 acres (0.588 hectares) and forms part of the wider 80 acre (32 ha) Shopwyke Lakes development. It is situated adjacent to one of the two feature lakes and areas of landscaped open space that serve as key focal points within the scheme. Overlooking the central lake, the site benefits from direct access to the main distributor road through the development, with a bus stop located directly opposite. It has been allocated for a high-density residential-led development, adjacent to the community facilities, retail units and sports playing facilities that were delivered in earlier phases. Two new pedestrian and cycle bridges, constructed as part of the wider development, provide connectivity to nearby amenities, including Portfield Retail Park, Chichester Water Sports Centre, several supermarkets, a gym and the South Downs National Park. Planning: The original outline permission for Shopwyke Lakes (ref:O/11/05283/OUT) designated the site for residential use up to four storeys. The wider scheme has been built out pursuant to this and subsequent permissions. However, the subject plot will require anew planning application for future development. More recently, the site had an appeal dismissed for a planning application for the erection of 87 apartments, including 10,000 sq. ft of Class E floor space, with associated parking, bike stores, landscaping and utilising existing access (ref: 23/00188/FUL). The appeal was dismissed principally on design grounds and the effect the proposal would have on the character and appearance of the area. The key takeaways from the inspector's report were: A 5-storey building could be supported, provided it tapers down in respect of the height of the existing residential buildings to the east. The design should address the main Longacres Way frontage, promoting an active street scheme, with parking situated behind a central cluster. A break in building form - potentially two separate blocks -should be incorporated to retain views of the central lake. The contemporary architectural style and material palette proposed were positively received. No additional public amenity space and play areas were deemed necessary, as these facilities are already well provided for within the wider Shopwyke Lakes development. The dismissed appeal scheme was seeking to provide zero affordable housing on viability grounds - this principle was agreed. The principle of a high-density residential-led scheme has been established and is encouraged, subject to design considerations. The site may also lend itself to a high-density housing scheme.

There are a mixture of uses in the surrounding area including residential housing in the immediate vicinity fronting the road either side of the site entrance, a trade builders' yard to the North and petrol filling station, supermarket to the west and hotel to the south. Description: The site extends to approx. 1.31 acres. NB.

In that application they referred to the existing use as a concrete batching plant and ancillary facilities.

It benefits from immediate access to Common Road to the north and the A259 coastal route to the south, with the A27 just a 5-minute drive away, offering fast links to Portsmouth, Brighton, and the wider South Coast. Further afield, the site offers excellent access to both the A3 and M3 corridors, making it ideal for businesses needing to connect efficiently to London, the Midlands, and the national motorway network. Nutbourne railway station is just 1.3 miles to the south, offering regular services across the South Coast and into London, making the site accessible for both staff and logistics. One of Apollo's most unique advantages is its location outside of major urban centres - avoiding the congestion and logistical headaches often associated with city-based industrial parks. Despite the peaceful, semi-rural surroundings, demand for modern commercial space in this area is high and availability is extremely limited, making Apollo a rare opportunity in a strategic and stress-free setting. Description: Apollo Business Park is undergoing a complete and high-quality transformation from a former HQ complex into a brand-new, thoughtfully designed business park. Every visible surface across the site is being replaced - including all groundworks, cladding, glazing, personal access doors, electronically operated sectional loading doors, and insulation - to deliver a modern, energy-efficient development targeting a significantly improved EPC rating. The site offers flexible and versatile accommodation across both ground and first floors, with unit sizes ranging from approximately 913 sq ft to 2,194 sq ft. Units can be easily combined to create larger spaces tailored to tenants' needs as required. Each floor benefits from generous ceiling heights of 3.7m, with electronically operated sectional loading doors (3m high x 3.9m wide) at ground floor level, providing excellent access and usability. The ceiling height also makes the units suitable for operations requiring vertical clearance - such as vehicle lifts, storage racking, or light manufacturing processes - offering versatility for a wide range of occupiers. The business park is set within a unique and picturesque environment, with open views over the South Downs National Park, and is surrounded by fields and woodland. A significant portion of the site itself includes grassed and wooded areas, creating an unusually green and attractive setting rarely found in similar developments. Security and accessibility have been prioritised throughout the design. The site is enclosed by a high-security perimeter fence and accessed via twin electric gates with a dedicated in-and-out traffic system, making it exceptionally secure and well suited to businesses with higher-value stock or equipment. The layout allows for excellent HGV access, and parking provision is generous - with over 20% of spaces fitted with EV chargers and overall capacity far exceeding typical estates of this type. Further benefits include: Full site-wide CCTV security system Access to dedicated high-speed leased line fibre Three-phase electricity supplied to every unit Full external LED lighting and LED lighting throughout each property The ability to scale operations with on-site container storage and additional future units Professionally landscaped grounds, creating a welcoming and high-quality working environment Each floor has the benefit of high ceilings (3.7m) with loading doors of 3m (H) x 3.9m (W) at ground floor level. Accommodation: The accommodation has the following approximate Gross Internal Area (GIA): Energy Performance Rating: Targeting EPC A Planning: Planning was obtained in 2025 to covert the site, previously used as the HQ for Charles Taylor Group (formerly CEGA), into a flexible E class (giii) business park. The full planning for the site is as follows; ""Refurbishment and redevelopment of existing buildings A and C and demolition and replacement of building B to create offices and light industrial units (use class E(g)(i-iii)), demolition of buildings D and E, installation of storage containers (use class B8) and associated works including reconfiguration of the car parking area to create additional parking spaces."" Full planning consent is available upon request. Taxation: The rateable values are to be assessed upon completion of the development however the units have been designed to target the small business rates relief threshold. Further information on this is available upon request. Terms: The units are available individually or by way combinations, for new effectively full repairing & insuring lease terms to be agreed. A service charge will be payable, contributing towards estate management and maintenance, with the landlords also insuring the building, with tenants subsequently reimbursing their fair portion.

It benefits from immediate access to Common Road to the north and the A259 coastal route to the south, with the A27 just a 5-minute drive away, offering fast links to Portsmouth, Brighton, and the wider South Coast. Further afield, the site offers excellent access to both the A3 and M3 corridors, making it ideal for businesses needing to connect efficiently to London, the Midlands, and the national motorway network. Nutbourne railway station is just 1.3 miles to the south, offering regular services across the South Coast and into London, making the site accessible for both staff and logistics. One of Apollo's most unique advantages is its location outside of major urban centres - avoiding the congestion and logistical headaches often associated with city-based industrial parks. Despite the peaceful, semi-rural surroundings, demand for modern commercial space in this area is high and availability is extremely limited, making Apollo a rare opportunity in a strategic and stress-free setting. Description: Apollo Business Park is undergoing a complete and high-quality transformation from a former HQ complex into a brand-new, thoughtfully designed business park. Every visible surface across the site is being replaced - including all groundworks, cladding, glazing, personal access doors, electronically operated sectional loading doors, and insulation - to deliver a modern, energy-efficient development targeting a significantly improved EPC rating. The site offers flexible and versatile accommodation across both ground and first floors, with unit sizes ranging from approximately 913 sq ft to 2,194 sq ft. Units can be easily combined to create larger spaces tailored to tenants' needs as required. Each floor benefits from generous ceiling heights of 3.7m, with electronically operated sectional loading doors (3m high x 3.9m wide) at ground floor level, providing excellent access and usability. The site is enclosed by a high-security perimeter fence and accessed via twin electric gates with a dedicated in-and-out traffic system, making it exceptionally secure and well suited to businesses with higher-value stock or equipment. The layout allows for excellent HGV access, and parking provision is generous - with over 20% of spaces fitted with EV chargers and overall capacity far exceeding typical, similar estates. Further benefits include: Full site-wide CCTV security system Access to dedicated high-speed leased line fibre Three-phase electricity supplied to every unit Full external LED lighting and LED lighting throughout each property The ability to scale operations with on-site container storage and additional future units Accommodation: The accommodation has the following approximate Gross Internal Area (GIA): Energy Performance Rating: Targeting EPC A. Planning: Planning was obtained in 2025 to covert the site, previously used as the HQ for Charles Taylor Group (formerly CEGA), into a flexible E class (giii) business park. The full planning for the site is as follows; ""Refurbishment and redevelopment of existing buildings A and C and demolition and replacement of building B to create offices and light industrial units (use class E(g)(i-iii)), demolition of buildings D and E, installation of storage containers (use class B8) and associated works including reconfiguration of the car parking area to create additional parking spaces."" Full planning consent is available upon request. Taxation: The rateable values are to be assessed upon completion of the development however the units have been designed to target the small business rates relief threshold. Further information on this is available upon request. Terms: The units are available individually or by way of combinations, for new effectively full repairing & insuring lease terms to be agreed. The rent for Unit 1 & 1a is £24,950 pax. A service charge will be payable, contributing towards estate management and maintenance, with the landlords also insuring the building, with tenants subsequently reimbursing their fair portion.

It benefits from immediate access to Common Road to the north and the A259 coastal route to the south, with the A27 just a 5-minute drive away, offering fast links to Portsmouth, Brighton, and the wider South Coast. Further afield, the site offers excellent access to both the A3 and M3 corridors, making it ideal for businesses needing to connect efficiently to London, the Midlands, and the national motorway network. Nutbourne railway station is just 1.3 miles to the south, offering regular services across the South Coast and into London, making the site accessible for both staff and logistics. One of Apollo's most unique advantages is its location outside of major urban centres - avoiding the congestion and logistical headaches often associated with city-based industrial parks. Despite the peaceful, semi-rural surroundings, demand for modern commercial space in this area is high and availability is extremely limited, making Apollo a rare opportunity in a strategic and stress-free setting. Description: Apollo Business Park is undergoing a complete and high-quality transformation from a former HQ complex into a brand-new, thoughtfully designed business park. Every visible surface across the site is being replaced - including all groundworks, cladding, glazing, personal access doors, electronically operated sectional loading doors, and insulation - to deliver a modern, energy-efficient development targeting a significantly improved EPC rating. The site offers flexible and versatile accommodation across both ground and first floors, with unit sizes ranging from approximately 913 sq ft to 2,194 sq ft. Units can be easily combined to create larger spaces tailored to tenants' needs as required. Each floor benefits from generous ceiling heights of 3.7m, with electronically operated sectional loading doors (3m high x 3.9m wide) at ground floor level, providing excellent access and usability. The site is enclosed by a high-security perimeter fence and accessed via twin electric gates with a dedicated in-and-out traffic system, making it exceptionally secure and well suited to businesses with higher-value stock or equipment.

It benefits from immediate access to Common Road to the north and the A259 coastal route to the south, with the A27 just a 5-minute drive away, offering fast links to Portsmouth, Brighton, and the wider South Coast. Further afield, the site offers excellent access to both the A3 and M3 corridors, making it ideal for businesses needing to connect efficiently to London, the Midlands, and the national motorway network. Nutbourne railway station is just 1.3 miles to the south, offering regular services across the South Coast and into London, making the site accessible for both staff and logistics. One of Apollo's most unique advantages is its location outside of major urban centres - avoiding the congestion and logistical headaches often associated with city-based industrial parks. Despite the peaceful, semi-rural surroundings, demand for modern commercial space in this area is high and availability is extremely limited, making Apollo a rare opportunity in a strategic and stress-free setting. Description: Apollo Business Park is undergoing a complete and high-quality transformation from a former HQ complex into a brand-new, thoughtfully designed business park. Every visible surface across the site is being replaced - including all groundworks, cladding, glazing, personal access doors, electronically operated sectional loading doors, and insulation - to deliver a modern, energy-efficient development targeting a significantly improved EPC rating. The site offers flexible and versatile accommodation across both ground and first floors, with unit sizes ranging from approximately 913 sq ft to 2,194 sq ft. Units can be easily combined to create larger spaces tailored to tenants' needs as required. Each floor benefits from generous ceiling heights of 3.7m, with electronically operated sectional loading doors (3m high x 3.9m wide) at ground floor level, providing excellent access and usability. The site is enclosed by a high-security perimeter fence and accessed via twin electric gates with a dedicated in-and-out traffic system, making it exceptionally secure and well suited to businesses with higher-value stock or equipment. The layout allows for excellent HGV access, and parking provision is generous - with over 20% of spaces fitted with EV chargers and overall capacity far exceeding typical, similar estates. Further benefits include: Full site-wide CCTV security system Access to dedicated high-speed leased line fibre Three-phase electricity supplied to every unit Full external LED lighting and LED lighting throughout each property The ability to scale operations with on-site container storage and additional future units Accommodation: The accommodation has the following approximate Gross Internal Area (GIA): Energy Performance Rating: Targeting EPC A. Planning: Planning was obtained in 2025 to covert the site, previously used as the HQ for Charles Taylor Group (formerly CEGA), into a flexible E class (giii) business park. The full planning for the site is as follows; ""Refurbishment and redevelopment of existing buildings A and C and demolition and replacement of building B to create offices and light industrial units (use class E(g)(i-iii)), demolition of buildings D and E, installation of storage containers (use class B8) and associated works including reconfiguration of the car parking area to create additional parking spaces."" Full planning consent is available upon request. Taxation: The rateable values are to be assessed upon completion of the development however the units have been designed to target the small business rates relief threshold. Further information on this is available upon request. Terms: The units are available individually or by way of combinations, for new effectively full repairing & insuring lease terms to be agreed. The rent for Unit 12 is £16,275 pax. A service charge will be payable, contributing towards estate management and maintenance, with the landlords also insuring the building, with tenants subsequently reimbursing their fair portion. Rent & accommodation schedule available on request. VAT: Rents and prices are quoted exclusive of, but may be subject to VAT. Legal Fees: Each party to bear their own legal costs incurred.

The building insurance is £491 per annum, shared equally with the owner of the flat above. Alternatively, we have been instructed to market the freehold interest, subject to the existing long leasehold flat and contract, at a guide price of £175,000. VAT: We understand that the property is not elected for VAT. Legal Fees: Each party to bear their own legal costs incurred. Anti-Money Laundering Regulations 2017: In accordance with current Government legislation, we are legally required to conduct Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks on all prospective purchasers or tenants where the transaction involves a capital value of €15,000 (EUR) or more, or a rental value of €10,000 (EUR) per calendar month or greater.

The town is well connected by roads with the B2145 giving direct access to Chichester and from there the A27 provides quick access to the east and west. Just off Kingsway, the Selsea Fish & Lobster coastal site is accessed via a slip road shared with a few fishermen's huts. It occupies a rare stretch of foreshore land, lying between Kingsway itself, the reinforced sea defence wall, and the expansive shingle beach just beyond. Description: The business was founded many years ago by Fred Freije and was very successful. There were 16 lobster fishing boats running out of the Selsey factory. Over the years the number of boats declined and when the factory closed earlier this year there were only 3 boats remaining. Global warming and over fishing were the primary reasons for the decline but Fred was able to keep the turnover and profitability up by importing lobsters from Nova Scotia. This required the renting of a secondary location inland to house the imports as the legislation does not permit the mixing of native and Canadian lobsters. This proved to be expensive and a decision was made to invest heavily in the Selsey factory which is apparently now one of only two factories in England permitted to house native and imported lobsters within the same premises. We understand things were improving and then Fred unexpectedly died and the business was inherited by his widow and his son. Neither had the knowledge or the desire to run the business and efforts were made to sell the business as a going concern. Whilst there was significant interest, no sale was concluded and the owners elected to place the business into administration. This coastal property features a purpose-built, detached lobster and shellfish processing facility, complete with integrated cold storage and a mezzanine level within the roof space, currently utilised as a staff area and additional storage. Positioned on the southwest side of the site are five external storage units/shipping containers, offering further operational flexibility. Adjacent to the main facility is Lagoon Cottage, a residential dwelling comprising six rooms across two floors. The ground floor includes a WC, kitchen, living room, lounge, and bedroom, while the upper level features an additional bedroom and generous low-eaves storage. The cottage is currently tenanted but will be offered with vacant possesion on completion of a sale. The main building underwent significant extension and internal reconfiguration in 1996. More recently, it has benefited from the installation of a new pitched roof and approximately 245 solar PV panels, enhancing energy efficiency.

The town is well connected by roads with the B2145 giving direct access to Chichester and from there the A27 provides quick access to the east and west. Just off Kingsway, the Selsea Fish & Lobster coastal site is accessed via a slip road shared with a few fishermen's huts. It occupies a rare stretch of foreshore land, lying between Kingsway itself, the reinforced sea defence wall, and the expansive shingle beach just beyond. Description: The business was founded many years ago by Fred Freije and was very successful. There were 16 lobster fishing boats running out of the Selsey factory. Over the years the number of boats declined and when the factory closed earlier this year there were only 3 boats remaining. Global warming and over fishing were the primary reasons for the decline but Fred was able to keep the turnover and profitability up by importing lobsters from Nova Scotia. This required the renting of a secondary location inland to house the imports as the legislation does not permit the mixing of native and Canadian lobsters. This proved to be expensive and a decision was made to invest heavily in the Selsey factory which is apparently now one of only two factories in England permitted to house native and imported lobsters within the same premises. We understand things were improving and then Fred unexpectedly died and the business was inherited by his widow and his son. Neither had the knowledge or the desire to run the business and efforts were made to sell the business as a going concern. Whilst there was significant interest, no sale was concluded and the owners elected to place the business into administration. This coastal property features a purpose-built, detached lobster and shellfish processing facility, complete with integrated cold storage and a mezzanine level within the roof space, currently utilised as a staff area and additional storage. Positioned on the southwest side of the site are five external storage units/shipping containers, offering further operational flexibility. Adjacent to the main facility is Lagoon Cottage, a residential dwelling comprising six rooms across two floors. The ground floor includes a WC, kitchen, living room, lounge, and bedroom, while the upper level features an additional bedroom and generous low-eaves storage. The cottage is currently tenanted but will be offered with vacant possesion on completion of a sale. The main building underwent significant extension and internal reconfiguration in 1996. More recently, it has benefited from the installation of a new pitched roof and approximately 245 solar PV panels, enhancing energy efficiency. At ground level, the facility primarily consists of cold storage areas complemented by administrative office space. Beneath the building are shellfish holding tanks, supplied with fresh seawater via a dedicated pipeline extending approximately 100 metres offshore.
