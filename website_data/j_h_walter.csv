Surrounded by flat Fenland landscapes, Gedney Dyke offers a relaxed, rural lifestyle close to the Norfolk coast while remaining within reach of larger towns and cities for essential needs.

These soils are free-draining and provide the ideal environment that supports consistently high yields across a range of crops, including root crops, brassicas, flowers, salads, vining peas, and all combinable crops. Furthermore, these highly productive soils are capable of intensive cultivation while remaining resilient, making them particularly well-suited to modern, high-output farming practices. With the ability to produce exceptional quality crops, this land is an asset for both established growers, those looking to expand their farming enterprise and investor buyers. The soils predominantly belong to the Romney and Wisbech Soil Associations (with some Agney), being deep stoneless permeable calcareous fine and coarse silty soils with ground water being controlled by ditches and pumps.

The property comprises the main house, adjoining annexe, stables, outbuildings, beautiful grounds and approximately 1.91 acres of paddock land. Barton House has been run as a guesthouse for 13 years, however planning permission has been obtained but not yet implemented for reversal of this change of use back to a private dwelling. The original part of the imposing house is believed to date back to the 1780s, when the then owners of East Lockinge, the Wymondsold family, agreed to provide a new rectory on a plot of land called Barton Close which gave the Georgian house its name. Later additions, including most recently in 2012, have created a large and versatile property, providing private and commercial buyers alike with a fantastic opportunity in a village where property of this size rarely becomes available. The house became part of the Lockinge Estate in 1853, when Lord Overstone purchased East Lockinge from the Wymondsold family as a present to his daughter Harriet Sarah Jones-Loyd upon her marriage to Colonel Loyd-Lindsay VC, who later became Lord and Lady Wantage. This is therefore the PP obtained for change of use back to a private dwelling Location Location Barton House is located between the sought-after villages of Ardington and East Lockinge, approximately 2 miles to the east of Wantage, which are situated within the North Wessex Downs National Landscape. The property benefits from excellent accessibility, with the A417 and A34 nearby connecting the M4 and M40, and the nearby mainline railway station at Didcot Parkway providing fast trains to London Paddington. The village of Ardington boasts an excellent village pub, tearoom, the Holy Trinity parish church and the Ardington & Lockinge Sports Club. Lockinge provides All Saints Church to which the original Barton House rectory was linked. More extensive amenities can be found in the nearby market town of Wantage which is serviced by a variety of shops, supermarkets and local amenities. A number of public footpaths and bridleways across the Estate can be accessed near Barton House. There is notable schooling nearby including Radley College, Abingdon School and St Helen & St Katharine's as well as an excellent range of schools in Oxford, Newbury and Reading. Further attractions include Newbury and Cheltenham racecourses, the historic Ridgeway and Blenheim Palace. Directions From Wantage take the A417 heading east. Take the second right hand turn signposted to Ardington and Lockinge. Follow the road downhill towards the village of East Lockinge. The driveway to Barton House will be found on the left after the turn to Ardington. Accommodation Accommodation The house is approached via a gravel drive between red brick pillars, leading to a large parking and turning area. The front door is accessed from the front parking area through a portico with impressive stone pillars and opens into a hall providing access to the drawing room, reception room, dining room, office and downstairs WC. The impressive drawing room has a fireplace and sash bay windows with window seats that provide wonderful views over the garden and countryside beyond. The reception room beyond the hall provides further views to the southeast, sash windows and leads to a spectacular triple aspect garden room with a vaulted glass ceiling. Bifold French doors lead from the garden room to the outdoor terrace to seamlessly blend indoor and outdoor living. The garden room is currently open plan from the reception room and dining room, which gives these rooms ample light and space. The dining room has a superb fireplace and access through to the commercial kitchen. The house has most recently been run as a guesthouse, with further details provided in the Planning section below. The kitchen is currently fitted with commercial equipment. To the northwest of the kitchen is a store area and access to the annexe, which itself provides an impressive fireplace, large living space, door to the northeast garden and French doors to a private southwest garden. The annexe is currently used as private accommodation. From the annexe living area there is access to a utility providing a sink and plumbing for a washing machine. The corridor leads to the annexe bedroom, which provides a dressing room and en-suite bathroom. A staircase leads to a mezzanine study. A further staircase leads down into the basement, which provides a large games room with access to the garden. Two staircases provide access to 6 en-suite double bedrooms on the first floor. The double aspect principal bedroom is of extremely generous proportions and features exposed beams, with a large sash bay window overlooking the gardens and open countryside beyond. The en-suite is complete with a freestanding bath, shower, WC and basin. The main staircase leads on to the second floor with a spacious landing providing access to a further 3 en-suite double bedrooms, all with feature fireplaces. The beautifully landscaped grounds lie to the east of the house and include a section of the Lockinge Brook, a pond and an orchard. Mature trees to the northeast and west provide the property with privacy. The annexe garden is fenced separately to the main garden and the paddocks lie to the north and south of the house.

Given the nature of the location and surrounding structures, we believe that undoubted potential exists to either refurbish and extend (to include potentially increasing the height of the building) or to demolish and redevelop the site in its entirety which extends to approximately 0.14 hectares (0.346 acres). Lincolnshire County Council, as our client, have deemed Crown House to now be surplus to requirements and existing staff are due to relocate to alternative Premises in Lincoln in June 2025 when vacant possession will become available. Our clients are in possession of a Structural Report which concludes that the building is not constructed of RAAC with the Report having been carried out in 2022. A copy of said Report is available to potential purchasers upon request through Brown&Co as the Sole Selling Agents. There are a number of surrounding structures that are 6 storeys in height, to include Danesgate House to the frontage of the subject property. We believe that alternative uses such as Student Accommodation, Residential Apartments and Hotel would meet with the approval of The Planning Department at Lincoln City Council, subject to the relevant surveys being undertaken by the proposed Developer and acceptable plans to be submitted in terms of Design & Access together with adequate provision of Car Parking, should this be required. Accommodation In terms of net internal area, Crown House briefly comprises as follows: Ground, First & Second - Offices & Premises - 1,350 sq m / 14,525 sq ft Business Rates The property may benefit from Small Business Rates Relief which may reduce the rates payable.

The whole is a delightful opportunity, having been acquired over 20 years ago by the current vendors who have created a very special family home, with a pleasing mix of modern fittings whilst taking great care to retain the distinctive original features which are apparent throughout. The original house dates to the 17th century with a substantial Victorian later addition across the south and eastern elevations which marry beautifully. The whole is constructed of traditional Norfolk red brick under a pantile roof. The accommodation is well arranged, with a good balance of elegant rooms, and relatively smaller and cosy rooms, particularly in the 17th century part of the house with the kitchen and snug enjoying a variety of beams and a superb inglenook fireplace with log burner in the latter. As expected, the formal rooms with high ceilings, fireplaces and attractive joinery are positioned across the southern and eastern wing of the property and benefit from fine views over the grounds and paddock beyond. The entrance hall with original Minton tiling establishes the tone of this area of the house and leads through to the principal dining room and drawing room and links well with the original house via an inner hall. Like many great farmhouses, ancillary to the whole is a utility room, pantry, cloakroom and a study with its own separate external access. There are two staircases at Hall Farm, the main Victorian staircase flows up to an attractive landing and provides access to the principal bedroom with dressing room, guest bedroom, family bathroom and bedroom four. A door on the landing leads through to bedroom five, the shower room and a useful store. A further staircase leads up to bedroom three which enjoys a charming en-suite with roll top bath; there are fine views across the front of the house from here. The approach to Hall Farm is highly impressive and provides a wonderful sense of arrival that befits the house. The shingled drive takes you up to the main façade with the gardens, pond and paddock in view across to the south, and upon approaching the house you are greeted by a number of outbuildings to the north which include an open cart shed, a barn with excellent potential subject to the necessary planning consents, and various single storey rendered brick and flint outbuildings used for general storage purposes. There is a courtyard here framed by these buildings and the gardens at the rear can be accessed from the courtyard via a shingled path. The grounds are a major feature of the property, great care, and attention has been taken by the current vendors to create a charming setting. To the South and East there are large areas of lawn with well stocked herbaceous borders and shrubberies which offer magnificent views back towards the house. There are many features within the grounds including three established ponds, three paddocks all divided by post and rail fencing and mature hedging with a number of fine trees. There is a charming terrace which sweeps across the various facades and importantly there is a super kitchen garden, greenhouse and an old well which provides the whole with a feel of what life was once like at Hall Farm. The whole is a delightful opportunity and is offered in excellent order throughout. Services - Oil fired central heating, mains water, private drainage system (septic tank), mains electricity. Broadband Speed - 80Mbps. LOCATION Location - Deopham benefits from being within striking distance to the thriving market town of Wymondham. The attractive town centre has some outstanding buildings including The Abbey, a good range of shops, public houses and cafes. Wymondham is supported by its own railway station with links to both Norwich and Cambridge via the A11 trunk road, the A47 Norwich southern bypass and Wymondham College is 2½ miles distant. DIRECTIONS Directions - From the A11, exit at Besthorpe/Spooner Row intersection, and follow the signs to Morley. At The Buck Inn public house, turn left and then second turning to the right. At the next 'T' junction turn left and then first right pass Deopham Church. Hall Farm is on the left-hand side.

It was designed by the distinguished Norfolk architect George John Skipper, with construction taking place between 1898 and 1900. Mancroft Towers is an impressive example of Jacobean Revival architecture, built of fine red brick elevations under tiled roofs, decorative diapering, moulded brickwork, mullioned and transomed windows, and stepped gables. The house's name and identity are derived from its distinctive corner tower, which forms a prominent architectural feature visible from the surrounding landscape. Internally, the house retains numerous original features of exceptional quality, including richly panelled rooms, a long gallery, ornate fireplaces, moulded plaster ceilings, and the Back family crest incorporated into the decorative scheme. These elements contribute significantly to the building's special interest and character, as recognised by its listing. The octagonal tower, located to the south-western elevation, rises above the principal façade and is constructed in matching red brick with decorative stone dressings. It features mullioned windows at each stage, providing extensive light and far-reaching views. Internally, the tower incorporates a narrow spiral staircase leading to an upper observation room which offers elevated vistas over Oulton Broad, the Waveney Valley, and the estate grounds. Historically, the tower is believed to have been used as a private study and viewing room. It remains a central and highly distinctive architectural element. The building today has been divided into three separate self-contained wings. The Cottage is attached to the main house and enjoys its own garden. The East Wing, formerly the kitchen and servants' quarters, was established as a separate dwelling after the Second World War and does not include its own garden. The Cottage and East Wing are currently let under Assured Shorthold Tenancies, the main house being occupied by the current owner. In addition to the main house (in its three parts), there is a detached two-bedroom cottage, known as The Lodge, which is available via separate negotiation, and offers ancillary or independent accommodation. We draw your attention to the floorplan as to how the accommodation is arranged. Externally the grounds have been beautifully tended by the current owner and extend as they do, to around 5.96 acres and include a tennis court, woodland, and substantial lawned gardens. The whole offers a great deal of privacy and will be of interest to buyers keen to establishing themselves in a special place with great potential. Further information on the income generating component to the property can be found through the selling agents. Services - Mains water, mains electricity, oil fired central heating, private drainage system (septic tank). LOCATION Mancroft Towers lies on Prospect Road (formerly known as Oulton Road), Oulton Broad, within the parish of Oulton Broad, East Suffolk. The house occupies a high position on Waveney Hill, affording views over Oulton Broad. The neighbourhood is residential and desirable, with other large homes set in substantial grounds. It is within convenient reach of local amenities in Oulton Broad - shops, restaurants, leisure and boating facilities - as well as access to transport via the nearby railway stations and A-roads connecting to Lowestoft, Norwich and the Suffolk coast.

The house has not come to the market in nearly 60 years and has been a much loved family home over that period. The property is constructed of brick with a pitched main roof and the accommodation is well arranged over two floors. The garage at the side was converted many years ago to a studio, being suitable for a number of purposes, and there is also a garage at the rear which is approached via the drive. The layout of the rooms works extremely well, with the main entrance hall leading through to an inner hall with access to the dining room, drawing room and sitting room/snug, which itself leads through to the garden room. The kitchen/breakfast room is well appointed with views over the garden to the rear, and there is an adjoining utility room and back lobby. The studio room is currently used as a home office but would be suitable for a number of purposes and could easily be a ground floor bedroom if required, linking in with the ground floor cloakroom. The bedroom accommodation works very well with four of the rooms having views out across to the marshes to the far side of the River Bure. There is a bathroom and shower room on the first floor. The grounds are a major feature of the property and the drive from the road leads up to the front of the house where there is hardstanding for a number of vehicles and then round to the rear and the garage area. The front gardens are mainly laid to lawn and the rear garden has been landscaped to include a pond and a woodland area providing some privacy and screening. The property has been well maintained over the years and is ready for immediate occupation. It will certainly appeal to those people looking to live close to Norwich and the Norfolk Broads, and the views to the front will be a special draw to interested parties. LOCATION Coltishall is situated about 9 miles from Norwich. There are excellent local shopping and transport facilities in the village. Access to the East Norfolk coast is good, and Wroxham is about 2 miles away, which is the centre of the Broads and linking in with the Broadland Network. Otherwise, the city of Norwich provides all amenities and is easily accessible and the northern distributor route is within 4 miles. This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a special Broadland residence on the edge of a popular village. DIRECTIONS Proceed out of Norwich on the North Walsham Road and continue over the northern distributor road, heading to Coltishall. At the filling station in Coltishall branch right onto Wroxham Road and continue until you reach the green. The property will then be seen on the left hand side as you leave Coltishall.

The house is particularly attractive and enjoys an array of striking, angled elevations being constructed primarily of rendered brickwork under a mixture of EPDM and green roofs and will be of interest to buyers keen on establishing themselves in an incredibly private location with a low maintenance feel throughout. The house is approached at the front of the property via a pedestrian gate from the private road or via the electric gated vehicular entrance which provides parking for a number of vehicles and leads up to the car port with the outstanding gardens in view. There are entrances at the rear of the house via two sets of bi-fold doors strategically positioned in both the kitchen dining room and sitting room providing a seamless link into the gardens. The main front door flows into an entrance hall with coat storage, and access is provided to the utility room and kitchen dining room. The kitchen dining room acts as the hub of the house with an array of skylights positioned across the angled roofline with a good range of fitted units flanking the central island. There are integrated Siemens appliances throughout the kitchen together with a hidden walk-in pantry with further kitchen storage units and worktops. Across from the kitchen in an open plan arrangement lies the sitting room with floor to ceiling glass and bi-fold doors providing a great deal of natural light to flood into this space, a key feature of the sitting room is the freestanding cylindrical wood burning stove together with the views across the private garden. A charming room on this floor is the WC which is alluringly hidden behind a bookcase. From the dining area, the staircase leads up to the first floor but also down into the lower ground floor where there are two double bedrooms and a four-piece suite family bathroom. on the first floor the principal bedroom is superbly presented with fitted wardrobes, Juliet balcony and a delightful en-suite shower room with reeded glass and stunning detail. The shower room also services the bedroom across the landing with both rooms benefiting from the angular roof lines and contemporary feel. The current vendors have replaced all bathrooms since acquiring the house in 2021, and the whole benefits from under-floor heating throughout. To the outside, the property is approached via a gravel drive off Judges Walk through electric gates to an open plan car port with adjoining garden storage area and there is parking for several vehicles. The gardens enjoy an attractive terrace with a good range of outdoor lighting positioned off the sitting room and dining area providing a seamless extension of the house. A major feature of the gardens are the delightful plant beds and silver birch trees beautifully positioned around the laid to lawn garden but much of the charm of the whole rests with the position which is incredibly private and cleverly bordered by a number of trees forming the boundary. Services - Mains water, mains drainage, mains electricity, gas central heating. LOCATION The property is located within walking distance of Eaton Village with all its local shopping and transport facilities, and about a mile from the centre of Norwich with easy access to the Norfolk & Norwich University Hospital, University of East Anglia and private and public schools.

Bidding window opens 11am on 16th March. Guide £950,000 plus fees. DESCRIPTION This outstanding and unusual Grade II Listed detached house situated in a Conservation Area comes to the market for the first time, having been let by the Trustees of the Norwich Freemen's Charity for well over 150 years. It represents an excellent opportunity to acquire a first class residence in need of renovation throughout and is constructed of brick with a pitched main roof with a number of elevations and occupies a super plot of land. The accommodation is well arranged on three floors and features an entrance hall with access to three main reception rooms, including dining room, drawing room and family room, with access through to ancillary rooms, breakfast room, and laundry room with access to the rear garden. There is also a cloakroom with access to the cellar.

There is a great deal of privacy and the house is well clothed with trees and shrubs. The gardens are mainly laid to lawn with flower borders and there is scope to landscape the rear garden in a number of ways. The whole will be of treat interest to a wide variety of buyers looking to acquire a special house in a special location.

How It Works: Unconditional Timed Auction Online: This is a binding method of sale similar to a traditional public property auction. The only difference is the bidding takes place online. The successful purchaser will be required to pay a 10% deposit (subject to a minimum payment of £5,000) on the fall of the virtual gavel and contracts will be exchanged. Bidding for properties online works in a similar fashion to eBay. You can place bids using your PC, tablet or mobile phone and the minimum amount you can bid is defined by the 'bid increment' level. When you place a bid, the property listing page will show you if your bid was successful and whether or not you are the highest bidder. When you are the highest bidder on a property, if another bidder outbids you the system will notify you by email so that you can place another bid if you wish. The major difference from eBay is that our system eradicates sudden death 'bid sniping' through the use of auction 'extension times'. If you have any questions or require any clarification please contact the auctioneer.

Location The property is positioned in Welches Dam, near to the village of Manea which has a station on the main line between Peterborough and Ely. It also has a village shop, village pub, the British legion community centre, a church, fishing lake, playing fields with recreation grounds with a vibrant and friendly community. Manea community primary school is rated good in a recent Ofsted report also. The property overlooks the renowned Ouse washes, a remarkable nature reserve which was created during the drainage of the fens in the 17th Century, the Ouse washes is now celebrated for its abundant wildlife and unique setting within the heart of the Cambridgeshire Fens. This internationally recognised wetland serves as a vital habitat for diverse bird species, including migratory swans and wading birds. Managed by the RSPB, It offers a tranquil retreat with spectacular seasonal displays of nature. In the winter, flocks of swans can be seen and heard flying over the house at dusk as they return to roost on the flooded washlands from feeding on the surrounding farmland. In the summer the wetland becomes grazing fields and the sound of drumming snipe and the calls of lapwing and redshank can be heard from the summer meadows. Conveniently located two miles from Manea station and within easy reach of Peterborough, Ely and Cambridge, it is an accessible must-visit destination for nature lovers, bird watchers and wildlife enthusiasts alike. The views from both the upper floors quite simply must be seen to appreciate fully. Summary The word unique is often overused in property however, Adventurers House, with uninterrupted views over the Ouse Washes can only be described as such. The house was built by the current owners in 1994, who have enjoyed this incredible landscape in both their professional and personal lives for over 30 years. First hand inspection is the only way one can gain a full appreciation of the property. The house is set on a plot of 0.96 acres. To the front is the Old Bedford River, where the owners have a mooring and beyond this the Ouse Washes. There is gravelled parking for up to four vehicles and a double garage facility that has a floored attic providing ample storage. The large rear wildlife garden is laid mainly to lawn with areas of natural habitat for birds and creatures great and small. Inside, the house was designed to offer spacious family living and to maximise the location and unique views. The space is impressive, approximately 304 m2 / 3280 sq ft arranged over three floors with some outstanding views. There is an entrance porch, hallway, downstairs toilet, sitting room, study, 7.5x4m open plan kitchen/dining room, conservatory, snug and utility/boot room to the ground floor. On the first floor, four double bedrooms and a family bathroom - the master having an en-suite. On the second floor is a further en-suite bedroom and large open-plan space which is highly versatile, used as an observation deck with extensive views to the South-East and North-West. In addition to the oil fired central heating, two wood burning stoves, one in the kitchen and one in the living room can provide an alternative source of heat. The current occupiers use logs from pollarded trees from the garden. Nine large solar panels on the roof combined with substantial storage batteries help to keep electricity bills low. Important Agents Note The Property is located east of the proposed Anglian Water Fenland Reservoir, a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) to help meet the growing demands on water supply in the East of England. Whilst not located within the site of the proposed reservoir itself, the Property is located within an area for associated water infrastructure to support the proposed reservoir.

This fee is due and payable from the winning bidder immediately after the timed auction ends. The successful bidder will additionally pay over to the auctioneer a deposit of 10% of the purchase price, subject to a minimum of £5,000, after the timed auction ends. All payments to be made by debit card payment or electronic bank transfer to the Brown&Co Client Account, the details of which will be provided by the auctioneer to the successful bidder shortly after the auction ends. Other fees may be payable on completion and will be detailed within the Special Conditions of Sale to be found within the published Auction Pack. Ability to Buy: This property is being sold under Unconditional Auction Rules creating a legally binding contract at the conclusion of the timed auction. DO NOT bid unless you can complete the sale within 28 days, or on the terms specified within the Special Conditions of Sale. Help and Assistance: If you have any questions or require any clarification as to the online auction process please contact the auctioneer prior to commencement of the bidding window as we will be unable to enter into any discussions once the auction has started. Bidding Process: Prior to bidding the bidder will complete a Passport-to-Bid process, which requires registration, verification and agreement to Buyers Terms. How To Follow the Auction: Use 'Watch' button to follow the auction. If you register to Watch an auction you will receive email notifications of any bidding activity on the specific lot. How It Works: Unconditional Timed Auction Online: This is a binding method of sale similar to a traditional public property auction. The only difference is the bidding takes place online. The successful purchaser will be required to pay a 10% deposit (subject to a minimum payment of £5,000) on the fall of the virtual gavel and contracts will be exchanged. Bidding for properties online works in a similar fashion to eBay. You can place bids using your PC, tablet or mobile phone and the minimum amount you can bid is defined by the 'bid increment' level. When you place a bid, the property listing page will show you if your bid was successful and whether or not you are the highest bidder. When you are the highest bidder on a property, if another bidder outbids you the system will notify you by email so that you can place another bid if you wish. The major difference from eBay is that our system eradicates sudden death 'bid sniping' through the use of auction 'extension times'. If you have any questions or require any clarification please contact the auctioneer.

Cromer's Bath House has sat proudly in prime position on the promenade, commanding breath-taking views over the pier and out to sea, since 1814. This striking building was first opened as a reading room but gained greatest fame as a retreat for wealthy Victorians to 'take the waters' away from public gaze. Its chequered past has seen it converted into a private residence in 1836, then into a hotel in 1872 by James Chapman, who added the west wing as a billiard room. It remained a hotel through to the end of the 20th Century when it was once again converted into a single, residence and now finally re-invented to become four beautifully individual luxury homes. Upper Bath House is the first floor apartment featuring stunning sea views from the living area, the kitchen dining area and the master bedroom. The funky open plan living, and dining space is to the front of the apartment, with the kitchen set off the main room but still part of the living space. This whole room is flooded with natural light from three floor to ceiling sash windows with uninterrupted sea views. The apartment boasts two fantastic bedrooms, with the principal bedroom to the front of the property, again commanding stunning views over the sea from dual aspect windows, a stunning bay window with a window seat at the gable end of the property and a further sash window looking out to the sea. The beautiful en-suite has a stunning shower enclosure, WC, wash hand basin and heated towel rail. The second bedroom to the rear of the apartment, features a sash window looking to the rear of the property and the adjacent family bathroom features a freestanding bath, wash hand basin, WC and heated towel rail. OUTSIDE Upper Bath House is just 12 metres from the beach, located directly on the promenade. Being on the first floor the apartment benefits from the stunning views and total privacy. Homeowners can drive directly onto the promenade and can apply for parking permits from North Norfolk District council. There are parking spaces immediately adjacent to the house for permit holders. The apartment is walking distance to all the local amenities. Including the cool new additions to the Cromer café scene; like Shoreline, the charming micro pub serving craft beers, cocktails and nibbles, Grey Seal Coffee shop serving fresh locally roasted coffee and Hatters Tea Room with their own brand loose leaf tea. LOCATION Perched literally on the promenade in the heart of Cromer, Upper Bath House is ideally located in every way. With direct unencumbered views of the ocean and the famous Victorian pier, the apartment is also within walking distance of all that Cromer has to offer. Cromer is famous for its seafood, most specifically the nationally renowned Cromer Crab. It is a bustling town catering for a thriving local community alongside the year-round tourists who visit the area. Much of the town is testament to its Victorian heyday including the lovely pier dating back that era. There is a plethora of restaurants, cafés, bars and pubs; catering to all tastes and budgets. Including the famous No. 1 Fish & Chip shop and a growing number of trendy eateries. The town has primary & secondary schools, a local hospital, supermarkets and cinema. For golf enthusiasts there are several world-class courses nearby. The Royal Cromer is walking distance from the front door (just under a mile along the coast path) famous for being designed by Tom Morris and James Braid. The links courses at Sheringham, Mundesley and Hunstanton are also within easy driving distance and are open to non-members. Cromer is well served by public transport with a train station and bus station providing links to Norwich and onwards to just about anywhere. HOLIDAY LET OPPORTUNITY Holiday Let Projected Income: £975 - £1600 per week. Holiday Let Projected Occupancy: c. 30 weeks pa. Sleeping: 4 in 2 Bedrooms. Upper Bath House is not currently a holiday let, however, two of the adjacent properties that form part of The Bath House are very successfully let for holidays. The unique position of the Bath House, directly on the promenade and the extremely high standard to which the apartment is presented would undoubtedly make it popular for visitors to the North Norfolk Coast. It may be possible to purchase Upper Bath House, as a turn key, with all the furniture and fixtures in place (aside from some personal items), by separate negotiation.",,,,['https://media2.jupix.co.uk/v3/clients/5/properties/408967/MED_408967_254219.pdf'],Brown & Co,Holt office,,,01263 711167,,,,To Let,2026-02-17,New

Tucked away in the heart of the super popular seaside town of Wells-next-the-Sea and located just a two minute walk from the quay, this flexible single storey home was originally configured as two cottages and now offers comfortable living as one residence, with the option to create a holiday annexe. There is a generous entrance hall with ample space for coats and boots which leads, across the central hallway to the open plan kitchen / dining / living room. This lovely room, with engineered oak flooring throughout, features an elevated kitchen area, which looks out over the room and a dining and living space which is arranged around the wood burning stove. The kitchen has a range of modern fitted units and an island looking out into the room, integrated double oven and grill, dishwasher and electric hob, a ceramic sink and laminated worktops with a window looking out to the front of the property. Accessed from this room is the first bedroom, the smaller of the bedrooms but still a good size, with an ensuite shower room off. The ensuite features a walk in shower, tiled floor with underfloor heating, WC, heating towel rail and wash hand basin. Along the central hallway is the second bedroom, a good sized double room with French doors out to the courtyard garden. At the end of the hallway is the main sitting room / bedroom three. A lovely room, spanning the width of the property, with a wood burning stove, French doors out to the covered seating area and courtyard garden. The utility room and family bathroom are accessed from this room and there is a door leading out to the side of the property for separate access. The utility room comprises a sink and drawers, wall cupboard, worktop with space and plumbing under for a washing machine, tumble dryer space and a rooflight window. The family bathroom has a Jacuzzi bath with shower mixer tap, wash hand basin with vanity unit, WC, heated towel rail and underfloor heating. Were it to be of interest, there would be scope to turn this area into a holiday let studio, with the utility room as a kitchen and separating the hallway access and part of the outside area. Or equally, creating a principal bedroom suite from the sitting room and using the open plan room as the main living space. OUTSIDE There is a fully enclosed courtyard garden area accessed from both the sitting room and the second bedroom, with a fantastic, covered seating area to one end. This is a charming sunny spot to enjoy sitting out with a book or a morning coffee. Barn Cottages is located on an unadopted lane with unrestricted parking to the front of the property. There is an alleyway to one side of the property, allowing access to the side door leading into the sitting room and also to 3 Barn Cottages, a separate small cottage at the end, which is attached to 1 Barn Cottages. HOLIDAY LET OPPORTUNITY 1 Barn Cottages was originally two separate properties and could be returned to this arrangement, creating a holiday studio apartment with its own access from the side. All three of the Barn Cottages have been very successful holiday lets in the past and whilst this property is currently a main residence, the third of the cottages is still operating as a holiday rental. LOCATION 1 -2 Barn Cottages is located just a few minutes' walk from the East Quay, within easy walking distance of all the vibrant seaside town has to offer. Wells-next-the-Sea is a super popular holiday destination which has a thriving permanent resident community and working fishing fleet. There is a lovely mixture of independent boutiques, galleries, food shops and cafes located along Staithe Street, which runs from the harbour up to the Buttlands, home to the famous Crown Hotel and The Globe, perfect for a spot of lunch or supper when you get back from the beach. Wells Beach is renowned in Norfolk and beyond for its endless sand and row of pretty beach huts that back onto the pinewoods. Walk for a couple of miles or so along the golden sands and you'll end up in Holkham. Whether you decide to sunbathe, swim, fly a kite or build a sandcastle, Wells beach has something for everyone. For wildlife lovers, wading birds can be seen on the foreshore, including terns, oystercatchers and avocets. If you're lucky you can even spot common and grey seals basking in the sun. There is a car park and wonderful beach cafe just behind the pinewoods, so if the stroll out to the beach from the harbour is a bit much carrying all the beach gear, you can drive up and walk over the dunes to the beach. Wells has so much to offer for both residents and visitors, it's the perfect base to explore both the West and East sides of the North Norfolk coastline and plenty to do if you decide not to leave at all!",,,,['https://media2.jupix.co.uk/v3/clients/5/properties/408996/MED_408996_254238.pdf'],Brown & Co,Holt office,,,01263 711167,,,,For Sale,2026-02-17,New

The house enjoys a charming feel throughout with majority of the original features still prominent and include wall to ceiling exposed beams, inglenook fireplaces and superb floorboards. The whole offers an exciting opportunity for buyers keen to make their mark on a house which has been in the same ownership for over 50 years and comes to the market for the first time in that period. The farmhouse can be accessed from both the rear and front, but with the situation of the parking area being at the rear it is most likely that any buyer will enter the property via the kitchen area which links with a pantry and the sitting room. The sitting room acts as one of the main focal points of the house with original open fireplace and an array of beams with fine views out over the gardens at the front. The sitting room flows to the main entrance hall which leads on into the dining room which benefits from an open fireplace and there is access at the side into the gardens. The ground floor flows particularly well and includes a ground floor bedroom and shower room accessed off the inner hall. On the first floor there are a total of four double bedrooms, a family bathroom and separate toilet accessed off the landing. The principal bedroom enjoys a dressing room which can be cleverly accessed off the main hall and is naturally suitable for general storage purposes if one wished. A key feature of the remaining three bedrooms is that they are complimented by fitted wardrobes. We draw your attention to the floorplan as to how the accommodation is arranged. May Tree Farmhouse is approached off the Foxley Road into the main shared drive of which May Tree Farmhouse has a right of way over. The drive leads down past the property and around to the rear where there is hardstanding for a number of vehicles with the garage in view. The garage itself has excellent potential and is a substantial outbuilding of traditional brick construction under a pantile roof and benefits from two large doors and a further adjoining outbuilding that acts as an excellent garden storage unit. There is certainly scope here to convert to something more elaborate subject to the necessary planning consents. The gardens for Maytree Farmhouse are well established and are marked via post and rail fencing which form the boundary. The gardens are predominately lawned but also feature a brick-built greenhouse and a brick store at the side of the property. The whole is offered with no onward chain. SERVICES Council Tax - The property is classified as Band E. (It is suggested that interested parties check the predicted Band charge prior to making an application). Local authority - Breckland District Council Services - Oil fired central heating, mains electricity, mains water, mains drainage. PLANNING MATTERS It is suggested that any prospective buyer checks the recent planning applications to the surrounding paddocks at the rear and side as well as the farmhouse itself. There are drawings and further detail through our architecture and planning department, and the plans are available on the Breckland District Council website: PL/2025/0081/HOU LOCATION Bawdeswell is a popular mid Norfolk village approximately 15 miles north-west of Norwich, there are regular buses running to Norwich. The village has a hall and playing field, a primary school and a convenience store, Bawdeswell Garden Centre, along with a popular café. The village also has a church and a post office. From the village, there is a bus service to the highly regarded Reepham High School which also has a sixth form. DIRECTIONS Proceed out of Norwich on the Fakenham Road and continue through Weston Longville and Sparham. On reaching Bawdeswell turn right off the Fakenham Road into Norwich Road and then take the second left into The Street. Continue through the centre of the village merging with the Foxley Road and the property will be seen on the left-hand side.

Occupying an enviable corner plot, this upside down cottage is beautifully presented throughout. Completed in 2014, the cottage boasts luxurious finishings throughout, including natural stone flooring in the hallway and kitchen, oak flooring, oak doors and quirky French doors from the living space looking out to the garden below. With two double bedrooms and two bathrooms on the ground floor, an open plan living space above with separate utility room and WC. There is a charming, enclosed garden wrapping around the cottage and designated parking. Perfectly located, just a few steps from the luxury Harper Hotel, walking distance from the popular village pub and just a mile inland from the coast at Morston and two miles from Blakeney. Downstairs, both bedrooms look out over the garden. They are two good sized double rooms, with the principal bedroom enjoying a smart ensuite shower room and bedroom two having use of the equally smart family bathroom, featuring a bath with shower over. Upstairs, the open plan living space has real 'wow' factor, with vaulted ceilings, deep bay window and charming arched window frame incorporating French doors which open on to the garden. The stylish shaker style kitchen is painted in 'Stiffkey Blue' with white stone worktops, a butler sink, electric range oven & hob, integrated dishwasher and American style fridge freezer.

HOLIDAY LET OPPORTUNITY Holiday Let Income: c.£670 - £1100 per week Holiday Let Occupancy: c. 20 - 25 weeks Sleeping 4 in 2 Bedrooms Lobster Cottage has been a much loved second home and more recently open to paying guests as a successful holiday let. The cottage could be available as a turnkey with all furniture and contents (minus some personal items), by separate negotiation. Langham is a popular destination for visitors to North Norfolk due to its proximity to the coastline but being just set back, it has a quieter more laid back feeling than the villages along the coast road itself.

The village is just two miles inland from the larger coastal village of Blakeney with its salt marshes leading out to Blakeney point, famous for seals, wildlife and birds and five miles from the Georgian market town of Holt. The village itself if home to the luxury Harper Hotel and the prestigious development that is home to Lobster Cottage, The Langham, is located just passed the hotel to the rear. Within easy walking distance of the cottage is the charming village gastropub, The Langham Blue Bell which serves delicious food and has a lovely beer garden to enjoy a glass or two in the summer sunshine.

How To Follow the Auction: Use 'Watch' button to follow the auction. If you register to Watch an auction you will receive email notifications of any bidding activity on the specific lot. How It Works: Unconditional Timed Auction Online: This is a binding method of sale similar to a traditional public property auction. The only difference is the bidding takes place online. The successful purchaser will be required to pay a 10% deposit (subject to a minimum payment of £5,000) on the fall of the virtual gavel and contracts will be exchanged. Bidding for properties online works in a similar fashion to eBay. You can place bids using your PC, tablet or mobile phone and the minimum amount you can bid is defined by the 'bid increment' level. When you place a bid, the property listing page will show you if your bid was successful and whether or not you are the highest bidder. When you are the highest bidder on a property, if another bidder outbids you the system will notify you by email so that you can place another bid if you wish. The major difference from eBay is that our system eradicates sudden death 'bid sniping' through the use of auction 'extension times'. If you have any questions or require any clarification please contact the auctioneer.

An upside down house with two double bedrooms and a bathroom on the ground and an open plan living space on the first floor with stunning views of the garden. The interior has been thoughtfully decorated and styled throughout. The entrance hall is inviting drawing the eye up to the first floor, with cosy bedrooms and the family bathroom on the ground floor. Both double bedrooms have built in wardrobes and windows to the side and front overlooking the garden. The bathroom has a traditional bath with a shower over, a loo and hand wash basin. The open plan living space is flooded with light and has a sitting area at one end with a glass door leading out to the decked balcony and a kitchen and dining area at the other.

LOCATION Weybourne is a picture perfect old fishing village situated in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty on the north Norfolk Coast. The village is bursting with winding roads and brick and flint cottages, many dating back to the 17th century. Weybourne has a quiet shingle beach with a backdrop of cliffs leading to Sheringham in one direction and Blakeney Point in the other. Surrounded by fields, woodland and heathland, the area is perfect for walking and enjoying both the countryside and the coast. If walking isn't your thing you can also enjoy the North Norfolk Railway (the 'Poppyline'), a preserved steam railway connecting the towns of Sheringham and Holt, passing through Weybourne Station. The Ship is a very popular gastro pub, located in the centre of the village. It is popular with both locals and visitors alike and serves very good food and drink. There is also a charming village store / coffee shop, which stocks essentials, serves lovely coffee and freshly prepared snacks - perfect for when you are just back from the beach. With no more than 600 people living here, there is a real sense of a local community and with so much to do and see at Weybourne, it really is a superb holiday destination at any time of the year. Weybourne is just under 4 miles from the bustling Georgian town of Holt and 3 miles from the seaside town of Sheringham. There are supermarkets, schools, lovely restaurants, shops, schools and doctor surgeries all nearby. Agents Note: Mill End is within the Low to Medium Flood Risk Area designated by the Land Registry.

Bidding for properties online works in a similar fashion to eBay. You can place bids using your PC, tablet or mobile phone and the minimum amount you can bid is defined by the 'bid increment' level. When you place a bid, the property listing page will show you if your bid was successful and whether or not you are the highest bidder. When you are the highest bidder on a property, if another bidder outbids you the system will notify you by email so that you can place another bid if you wish. The major difference from eBay is that our system eradicates sudden death 'bid sniping' through the use of auction 'extension times'. If you have any questions or require any clarification please contact the auctioneer.

The property occupies a commanding position in the heart of the village, with a large plot and views over the war memorial. The grounds provide ample parking for a large number of vehicles with garden area to the rear. Accommodation The accommodation includes a ground floor with porch, sitting room and dining room, both with fireplaces. On the first floor there are two bedrooms and a modern shower room. The property would benefit from internal updating throughout. To the rear of the property is a partially completed extension. This was to provide a kitchen/breakfast room, ground floor bedroom and shower room. Please refer to the Agent's Notes below. Given the size of the plot, the property offers significant scope to enlarge should one wish and may have greater potential for development, subject to relevant planning permissions being granted, see agents note 3. Location Dersingham is one of the most sought-after and well-appointed villages in Norfolk. It is located on the edge of the Royal Estate in Sandringham and approximately 9 miles from the town of Kings Lynn. The superb array of local amenities in the village is nothing short of astounding; these include a Co-op and Spar supermarket, Garden centre, three public houses/social club, two schools, pharmacy, hairdresser and beauty parlour, butcher, takeaways, post office and newsagent with newspaper deliveries to name a few! Nearby, Kings Lynn has many of the high street stores one would expect from a large town and also benefits from a mainline train station to Ely, Cambridge and London. Dersingham also sits as a gateway village to the coast with beaches just a short drive away at Snettisham, Heacham, Hunstanton and beyond. Agent's Notes: 1. We understand that a planning enforcement matter is currently pending in respect of the partially completed rear extension. It is assumed that the incoming purchaser will be required either to comply with the enforcement requirements or to remove the extension. 2. Due to the planning enforcement position, the property may not currently be suitable for mortgage borrowing and viewers are advised to check with their mortgage broker the suitability before viewing. 3. There may be potential for further development within the grounds, subject to the necessary planning consents. The owners are in the process of preparing a planning application for an additional dwelling attached to the main house. 4. An easement is in place for an electricity substation located within the curtilage of the property.

There is a garage to the rear, being approached via a back drive over a shared loke which is shared by a number of other properties.

The grounds at the front are south facing, being mainly laid to lawn with flower borders and specimen trees. The property has not come to the market for many years and offers a great deal of privacy in one of the more popular villages south of Norwich. Solicitor: Leathes Prior (Attn Bethany Slaughter), 74 The Close, Norwich, NR1 4DR. Tel 01603 610911 LOCATION Shotesham St Mary is situated in south Norfolk, about 6 miles from Norwich.

The city of Norwich offers all sorts of amenities and, being the regional capital of East Anglia, its proximity to this property is very relevant. DIRECTIONS Proceed out of Norwich and travel through Lakenham and out on the Stoke Holy Cross Road. Travel through Shotesham and turn right after the Globe public house and then immediately right and travel along the road for about 100 yards and the loke leading to the property will be seen on the right hand side. VIEWING Please call us for viewing arrangements EPC E AGENT'S NOTES: Buyer Fees: Please note that the successful bidder will be required to pay an Administration Charge of £1,170 inclusive of VAT. This fee is due and payable from the winning bidder immediately after the timed auction ends. The successful bidder will additionally pay over to the auctioneer a deposit of 10% of the purchase price, subject to a minimum of £5,000, after the timed auction ends. All payments to be made by debit card payment or electronic bank transfer to the Brown&Co Client Account, the details of which will be provided by the auctioneer to the successful bidder shortly after the auction ends. Other fees may be payable on completion and will be detailed within the Special Conditions of Sale to be found within the published Auction Pack. Ability to Buy: This property is being sold under Unconditional Auction Rules creating a legally binding contract at the conclusion of the timed auction. DO NOT bid unless you can complete the sale within 28 days, or on the terms specified within the Special Conditions of Sale. Help and Assistance: If you have any questions or require any clarification as to the online auction process please contact the auctioneer prior to commencement of the bidding window as we will be unable to enter into any discussions once the auction has started. Bidding Process: Prior to bidding the bidder will complete a Passport-to-Bid process, which requires registration, verification and agreement to Buyers Terms. How To Follow the Auction: Use 'Watch' button to follow the auction. If you register to Watch an auction you will receive email notifications of any bidding activity on the specific lot. How It Works: Unconditional Timed Auction Online: This is a binding method of sale similar to a traditional public property auction. The only difference is the bidding takes place online. The successful purchaser will be required to pay a 10% deposit (subject to a minimum payment of £5,000) on the fall of the virtual gavel and contracts will be exchanged. Bidding for properties online works in a similar fashion to eBay. You can place bids using your PC, tablet or mobile phone and the minimum amount you can bid is defined by the 'bid increment' level. When you place a bid, the property listing page will show you if your bid was successful and whether or not you are the highest bidder. When you are the highest bidder on a property, if another bidder outbids you the system will notify you by email so that you can place another bid if you wish. The major difference from eBay is that our system eradicates sudden death 'bid sniping' through the use of auction 'extension times'. If you have any questions or require any clarification please contact the auctioneer.

LOCATION The land is located in Heacham well-regarded coastal village and resort and neighbour of Victorian seaside town of Hunstanton.

DESCRIPTION The land is accessed via High Street and is a level site of vacant land, a former Bowling Green. The site benefits from a positive pre-application planning response from May 2025, with it being considered that the principle of some form of residential development would be acceptable, subject to appropriate layout, scale, design and consideration of the impact on neighbouring properties. There may be potential for the development of two or more dwellings, although this would be dependent on detailed design proposals demonstrating that the scheme responds appropriately to the character and context of the area and its relationship with surrounding development.

How To Follow the Auction: Use 'Watch' button to follow the auction. If you register to Watch an auction you will receive email notifications of any bidding activity on the specific lot. How It Works: Unconditional Timed Auction Online: This is a binding method of sale similar to a traditional public property auction. The only difference is the bidding takes place online. The successful purchaser will be required to pay a 10% deposit (subject to a minimum payment of £5,000) on the fall of the virtual gavel and contracts will be exchanged. Bidding for properties online works in a similar fashion to eBay. You can place bids using your PC, tablet or mobile phone and the minimum amount you can bid is defined by the 'bid increment' level. When you place a bid, the property listing page will show you if your bid was successful and whether or not you are the highest bidder. When you are the highest bidder on a property, if another bidder outbids you the system will notify you by email so that you can place another bid if you wish. The major difference from eBay is that our system eradicates sudden death 'bid sniping' through the use of auction 'extension times'. If you have any questions or require any clarification please contact the auctioneer.

DO NOT bid unless you can complete the sale within 28 days, or on the terms specified within the Special Conditions of Sale. Help and Assistance: If you have any questions or require any clarification as to the online auction process please contact the auctioneer prior to commencement of the bidding window as we will be unable to enter into any discussions once the auction has started. Bidding Process: Prior to bidding the bidder will complete a Passport-to-Bid process, which requires registration, verification and agreement to Buyers Terms. How To Follow the Auction: Use 'Watch' button to follow the auction. If you register to Watch an auction you will receive email notifications of any bidding activity on the specific lot. How It Works: Unconditional Timed Auction Online: This is a binding method of sale similar to a traditional public property auction. The only difference is the bidding takes place online. The successful purchaser will be required to pay a 10% deposit (subject to a minimum payment of £5,000) on the fall of the virtual gavel and contracts will be exchanged. Bidding for properties online works in a similar fashion to eBay. You can place bids using your PC, tablet or mobile phone and the minimum amount you can bid is defined by the 'bid increment' level. When you place a bid, the property listing page will show you if your bid was successful and whether or not you are the highest bidder. When you are the highest bidder on a property, if another bidder outbids you the system will notify you by email so that you can place another bid if you wish. The major difference from eBay is that our system eradicates sudden death 'bid sniping' through the use of auction 'extension times'. If you have any questions or require any clarification please contact the auctioneer.

The accommodation is arranged on two floors with entrance porch, sitting room and kitchen/breakfast room on the ground floor, together with landing, bathroom and two bedrooms on the first floor. The property requires complete renovation and this is an excellent opportunity to acquire a special place in a rural position with scope to extend, subject to the necessary planning consent being forthcoming.

This fee is due and payable from the winning bidder immediately after the timed auction ends. The successful bidder will additionally pay over to the auctioneer a deposit of 10% of the purchase price, subject to a minimum of £5,000, after the timed auction ends. All payments to be made by debit card payment or electronic bank transfer to the Brown&Co Client Account, the details of which will be provided by the auctioneer to the successful bidder shortly after the auction ends. Other fees may be payable on completion and will be detailed within the Special Conditions of Sale to be found within the published Auction Pack. Ability to Buy: This property is being sold under Unconditional Auction Rules creating a legally binding contract at the conclusion of the timed auction. DO NOT bid unless you can complete the sale within 28 days, or on the terms specified within the Special Conditions of Sale. Help and Assistance: If you have any questions or require any clarification as to the online auction process please contact the auctioneer prior to commencement of the bidding window as we will be unable to enter into any discussions once the auction has started. Bidding Process: Prior to bidding the bidder will complete a Passport-to-Bid process, which requires registration, verification and agreement to Buyers Terms. How To Follow the Auction: Use 'Watch' button to follow the auction. If you register to Watch an auction you will receive email notifications of any bidding activity on the specific lot. How It Works: Unconditional Timed Auction Online: This is a binding method of sale similar to a traditional public property auction. The only difference is the bidding takes place online. The successful purchaser will be required to pay a 10% deposit (subject to a minimum payment of £5,000) on the fall of the virtual gavel and contracts will be exchanged. Bidding for properties online works in a similar fashion to eBay. You can place bids using your PC, tablet or mobile phone and the minimum amount you can bid is defined by the 'bid increment' level. When you place a bid, the property listing page will show you if your bid was successful and whether or not you are the highest bidder. When you are the highest bidder on a property, if another bidder outbids you the system will notify you by email so that you can place another bid if you wish. The major difference from eBay is that our system eradicates sudden death 'bid sniping' through the use of auction 'extension times'. If you have any questions or require any clarification please contact the auctioneer.

When you are the highest bidder on a property, if another bidder outbids you the system will notify you by email so that you can place another bid if you wish. The major difference from eBay is that our system eradicates sudden death 'bid sniping' through the use of auction 'extension times'.

Shared Ownership gives first time buyers and those that do not currently own a home the opportunity to purchase a share in a new build or resales property, The purchaser pays a mortgage on the share they own, and pays rent to a housing association on the remaining share. Because the purchaser only needs a mortgage for the share they are purchasing, the amount of money required for a deposit is a lot lower when compared to the amount that would be required when purchasing outright. The purchaser has the option to increase his share during their time in the property via a process known as 'staircasing', and in most cases can staircase all the way to 100%, thereby owning the property outright. snared ownership properties are always leasehold. How shared ownership works With shared ownership, you buy between a quarter and three-quarters of a property. You have the option to buy a bigger share in the property at a later date. These schemes are aimed at people who don't earn enough to buy a home outright. Most of the homes available are newly built, but some are properties being re-sold by housing associations. Who can apply for Shared Ownership? - First-time buyers or those who used to own a home but can't afford one now - People whose combined household income is less than £80,000 (in London, it's less than £90,000) - You rent a council or housing association property. You don't have to be a key worker, such as a nurse or teacher, to apply for shared ownership. Military personnel will be given priority over other applicants. Advantages of shared ownership It can enable you to get onto the property ladder more quickly than you might if you were buying a home outright. You can buy additional shares as time goes on and you save more or pay off more of your mortgage It may be cheaper than renting (but not always) You can sell a shared ownership property at any time, and will benefit from any increase in value it's seen since you bought it.",,,PE30 5GB,[],Brown & Co,King's Lynn office,,,01553 770771,,,Leasehold,,2026-02-17,New

Help and Assistance: If you have any questions or require any clarification as to the online auction process please contact the auctioneer prior to commencement of the bidding window as we will be unable to enter into any discussions once the auction has started. Bidding Process: Prior to bidding the bidder will complete a Passport-to-Bid process, which requires registration, verification and agreement to Buyers Terms. How To Follow the Auction: Use 'Watch' button to follow the auction. If you register to Watch an auction you will receive email notifications of any bidding activity on the specific lot. How It Works: Unconditional Timed Auction Online: This is a binding method of sale similar to a traditional public property auction. The only difference is the bidding takes place online. The successful purchaser will be required to pay a 10% deposit (subject to a minimum payment of £5,000) on the fall of the virtual gavel and contracts will be exchanged. Bidding for properties online works in a similar fashion to eBay. You can place bids using your PC, tablet or mobile phone and the minimum amount you can bid is defined by the 'bid increment' level. When you place a bid, the property listing page will show you if your bid was successful and whether or not you are the highest bidder. When you are the highest bidder on a property, if another bidder outbids you the system will notify you by email so that you can place another bid if you wish. The major difference from eBay is that our system eradicates sudden death 'bid sniping' through the use of auction 'extension times'. If you have any questions or require any clarification please contact the auctioneer.

The nearby Market Towns of Long Sutton and Holbeach have supermarkets and a wide array of independent shops and weekly markets and are only a 5 minute drive away.

Surrounded by flat Fenland landscapes, Gedney Dyke offers a relaxed, rural lifestyle close to the Norfolk coast while remaining within reach of larger towns and cities for essential needs. The area around Gedney Dyke is predominantly agricultural in nature with highly productive arable land, focussed on the production of horticultural crops, root crops (including potatoes, onions and sugar beet) as well as field vegetables, salads, pulses and combinable crops. LAND White House Farm comprises Grade 1 silty soils which are regarded as some of the most fertile and versatile agricultural land in the UK. These soils are free-draining and provide the ideal environment that supports consistently high yields across a range of crops, including root crops, brassicas, flowers, salads, vining peas, and all combinable crops. Furthermore, these highly productive soils are capable of intensive cultivation while remaining resilient, making them particularly well-suited to modern, high-output farming practices. With the ability to produce exceptional quality crops, this land is an asset for both established growers, those looking to expand their farming enterprise and investor buyers. The soils predominantly belong to the Romney and Wisbech Soil Associations (with some Agney), being deep stoneless permeable calcareous fine and coarse silty soils with ground water being controlled by ditches and pumps.

The property comprises the main house, adjoining annexe, stables, outbuildings, beautiful grounds and approximately 1.91 acres of paddock land. Barton House has been run as a guesthouse for 13 years, however planning permission has been obtained but not yet implemented for reversal of this change of use back to a private dwelling. The original part of the imposing house is believed to date back to the 1780s, when the then owners of East Lockinge, the Wymondsold family, agreed to provide a new rectory on a plot of land called Barton Close which gave the Georgian house its name. Later additions, including most recently in 2012, have created a large and versatile property, providing private and commercial buyers alike with a fantastic opportunity in a village where property of this size rarely becomes available. The house became part of the Lockinge Estate in 1853, when Lord Overstone purchased East Lockinge from the Wymondsold family as a present to his daughter Harriet Sarah Jones-Loyd upon her marriage to Colonel Loyd-Lindsay VC, who later became Lord and Lady Wantage. This is therefore the PP obtained for change of use back to a private dwelling Location Location Barton House is located between the sought-after villages of Ardington and East Lockinge, approximately 2 miles to the east of Wantage, which are situated within the North Wessex Downs National Landscape. The property benefits from excellent accessibility, with the A417 and A34 nearby connecting the M4 and M40, and the nearby mainline railway station at Didcot Parkway providing fast trains to London Paddington. The village of Ardington boasts an excellent village pub, tearoom, the Holy Trinity parish church and the Ardington & Lockinge Sports Club. Lockinge provides All Saints Church to which the original Barton House rectory was linked. More extensive amenities can be found in the nearby market town of Wantage which is serviced by a variety of shops, supermarkets and local amenities. A number of public footpaths and bridleways across the Estate can be accessed near Barton House. There is notable schooling nearby including Radley College, Abingdon School and St Helen & St Katharine's as well as an excellent range of schools in Oxford, Newbury and Reading. Further attractions include Newbury and Cheltenham racecourses, the historic Ridgeway and Blenheim Palace. Directions From Wantage take the A417 heading east. Take the second right hand turn signposted to Ardington and Lockinge. Follow the road downhill towards the village of East Lockinge. The driveway to Barton House will be found on the left after the turn to Ardington. Accommodation Accommodation The house is approached via a gravel drive between red brick pillars, leading to a large parking and turning area. The front door is accessed from the front parking area through a portico with impressive stone pillars and opens into a hall providing access to the drawing room, reception room, dining room, office and downstairs WC. The impressive drawing room has a fireplace and sash bay windows with window seats that provide wonderful views over the garden and countryside beyond. The reception room beyond the hall provides further views to the southeast, sash windows and leads to a spectacular triple aspect garden room with a vaulted glass ceiling. Bifold French doors lead from the garden room to the outdoor terrace to seamlessly blend indoor and outdoor living. The garden room is currently open plan from the reception room and dining room, which gives these rooms ample light and space. The dining room has a superb fireplace and access through to the commercial kitchen. The house has most recently been run as a guesthouse, with further details provided in the Planning section below. The kitchen is currently fitted with commercial equipment. To the northwest of the kitchen is a store area and access to the annexe, which itself provides an impressive fireplace, large living space, door to the northeast garden and French doors to a private southwest garden. The annexe is currently used as private accommodation. From the annexe living area there is access to a utility providing a sink and plumbing for a washing machine. The corridor leads to the annexe bedroom, which provides a dressing room and en-suite bathroom. A staircase leads to a mezzanine study. A further staircase leads down into the basement, which provides a large games room with access to the garden. Two staircases provide access to 6 en-suite double bedrooms on the first floor. The double aspect principal bedroom is of extremely generous proportions and features exposed beams, with a large sash bay window overlooking the gardens and open countryside beyond. The en-suite is complete with a freestanding bath, shower, WC and basin. The main staircase leads on to the second floor with a spacious landing providing access to a further 3 en-suite double bedrooms, all with feature fireplaces. The beautifully landscaped grounds lie to the east of the house and include a section of the Lockinge Brook, a pond and an orchard.

It comprises part brownfield and part greenfield land, the former being the Mellor Metals scrap metal recycling yard and the latter pasture land. The site is generally flat other than for a gentle slope west to east. The western frontage of the site comprises four existing dwellings which are to be retained by the owners, although they could be made available by separate negotiation. Location The site is situated on the eastern edge of Great Ellingham, on the north side of the B1077 Attleborough Road. Great Ellingham is 2.50 miles North West of Attleborough, 12 miles from Dereham and approx. 17 miles south west of the City of Norwich. The site is a semi-rural location less than 1.70 miles from the A11 trunk road. Accommodation The property is freehold and vacant possession will be given according to an agreement relating to the cessation of the Mellor Metals site after completion. Services Mains electricity, a mains water supply and mains drainage are available on site. Viewing Viewing is by appointment only through this office. VAT VAT is likely to be charged on the purchase. Other CIL There is no C.I.L chargeable in relation to this site under the terms of the existing planning permission. DISPUTES Should any dispute arise as to the boundaries or any point arising in these particulars, schedule, plans or interpretation of any of them the question shall be referred to the arbitration of the Selling Agent, whose decision acting as expert shall be final. The buyer shall be deemed to have full knowledge of all boundaries and neither the seller nor the seller's agents will be responsible for defining the boundaries or the ownership thereof. HEALTH AND SAFETY Viewers should be careful and vigilant whilst on the site of which part is an operational metal recycling plant. Access is available by appointment. Neither the seller nor the selling agents are responsible for the safety of those viewing the property without accompaniment and accordingly those viewing the property do so at their own risk. Terms The site benefits from outline planning permission for up to 75 dwellings granted on the 7th April 2017 from Breckland District Council under reference 3PL/2016/0648/O. All other matters are reserved. The proposed net density amounts to 25 dwellings per hectare including the existing four dwellings. The concept is for a single point of vehicular access, integration of walking and cycle links, public open space and a variety of housing types, sizes and tenure. AFFORDABLE HOUSING The current proportion of affordable housing proposed is consistent with Breckland Council's affordable housing policyat 40%. The mix is 65% rented and 35% intermediate housing. The Local Authority has previously discussed viability, although the Valuation Office on their behalf confirmed 40% to be appropriate. The owners are currently undertaking detailed intrusive contamination and ground surveys with which to enter more informed discussions and we hope to identify a preferred bidder to engage with the process to add value and work up a detailed scheme. Although the principle bid should be in accordance with the permission, to assist with the decision it would be helpful to receive alternative bids at various revised levels of affordable housing; assuming 30%, 20% and 10%.

It is bordered by mature hedging where it fronts Gowthorpe Lane and Main Road. There is also hedging and mature trees to the south of the site providing a natural boundary between the land and the neighbouring properties. Location The land is a corner site, north of the village, with road frontage onto Main Road and Gowthorpe Lane, Swardeston. The village of Swardeston lies to the south of Norwich off the A47 southern bypass. The village is connected by the B1113, which connects into the A140 giving direct access to the centre of Norwich some 4.5 miles to the north. Viewing VIEWING AND FURTHER INFORMATION The land can be viewed from the roadside. However, should any party wish to access the land they may do so on foot only, with a copy of the particulars to hand. No vehicular access will be allowed. Contact: Nick Dawes Tel: 01476 514433 Mob: 07768 465725 Email: nick.dawes@brown-co.com VAT The guide price quoted in these particulars of sale is exclusive of VAT. It is understood that the land is not currently elected to charge VAT although the vendor's reserve the right to do so prior to any sale. Other PLANNING The land falls within the planning jurisdiction of South Norfolk Council. The current adopted Local Plan identifies this land as SWA1, and refers to Policy 15 of the Joint Core Strategy identifying Swardeston as a Service Village in which land will be allocated for small scale housing growth during the period 1st April 2008 to 31st March 2026. Policy SWA1, Land on Main Road, Swardeston The site lies to the south-east of the junction between Main Road and Gowthorpe Lane. The land amounts to some 2.7 hectares (6.67 acres) is allocated for housing and associated infrastructure. This allocation could accommodate approximately 30 dwellings reflecting density and development elsewhere in the village. The development of this site is required to ensure the following: a) Historic environment records to be consulted to determine any need for archaeological survey prior to development. b) Norfolk Minerals and Waste Core Strategy Policy CS16 applies as this site is underlaid by safeguarded mineral resources. c) Waste-water infrastructure capacity must be confirmed prior to any development taking place and this should include sustainable urban drainage systems. CARE HOME USE The vendors preference is for the site, or part of it to be used for a Care Home provision. No direct discussions have been had with Planning Officers with regard to a Care Home provision on the site, however, it is believed that this use type would be compatible with its residential allocation. RESIDENTIAL DENSITY The site allocation has a stated number of houses of up to 30 dwellings. Although no direct discussion has been had with the Local Planning Authority it is expected that they would be prepared to consider a higher density in view of the wider pressure for housing delivery. LAND EDGED BLUE ON THE PLAN The land edged blue has a countryside allocation and is in the same ownership as the land edged red. Access to this land will be retained via a right through the allocated land for the benefit of future development. The vendors are open to proposals for an Option Agreement on this land in favour of the purchasers of the allocated element. ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION In accordance with the most recent Anti Money Laundering Legislation, buyers will be required to provide proof of identity and address to the selling agent once an offer has been submitted and accepted (subject to contract) prior to solicitors being instructed. Terms METHOD OF SALE Interested parties should make their own enquiries direct with the Local Planning Authority whether that be for a care home or residential use or a mixture of the two. Although the vendors preference is for some form of care home either on all or part of the site, they are open-minded and also interested in schemes that are purely for residential development. It is proposed that the allocated land will be sold on a conditional contract, subject to planning basis, with the purchase price having been agreed in advance of entering into the conditional contract.",,6.6,,['https://brownandcocrm.agencypilot.com/crm/store/documents/other/468331_828zy893t59m49hl.pdf'],Brown & Co,Nick Dawes,,,07768 465725,,,,For Sale,2026-02-17,New

The site has open views to both the north and south with far reaching views. The property comprises a redundant farmyard approximately 0.485 hectares (1.2 acres) in size. There are two agricultural buildings on the site and one is in a state of disrepair having suffered some recent storm damage. However, initial clearing up work of the damage and debris is currently underway. The site received Reserved Matters detailed planning approval for the appearance, landscaping, layout and scale, on 23th October 2024 (ref:24/02899/REM) following the granting of Outline planning permission on 5th November 2021 (ref:20/02114/out) for the demolition of the agricultural buildings and the construction of five dwellings. The Reserved Matters approval scheme comprises five dwellings with a total internal gross floor area of 1,188m2 (12,791sq ft) in a courtyard arrangement comprising a principle brick dwelling to the front and four barn style dwellings. The following planning conditions have also been discharged along with the Reserved Matters: - Archaeology Investigation (part - programme and timetable for the analysis, publication & dissemination to be discharged, but commencement of development is now permitted) - Ground investigation (PII) - Drainage strategy - Landscaping scheme Remaining notable conditions to be discharged include: - Approval of final materials - Submission of an energy statement with 10% carbon saving - Water efficiency calculator methodology through on-site renewables and low carbon technologies. - Biodiversity method statement & Ecological Enhancements - Lighting design strategy - Traffic Management Plan - Maintenance Plan for Common Parts The site represents an excellent opportunity to acquire a residential development site with a well progressed planning permission in place, enabling commencement of development to begin in a shorter timeframe with significant elements of the planning conditions and detailed design in place.

The approved scheme permits 151 dwellings, a new roundabout and access from Biggleswade Road, an area of employment land, a site for a community hall, and public open space. The main residential part of the overall site was purchased by Kier Living and the development of Kier's ""Tall Trees"" scheme is now well underway. See https://www.kierliving.co.uk/potton_tall-trees-14255. The site is located less than half a mile from Potton town centre and its picturesque Market Square. With a net developable area of 0.45 ha (1.1 acres) the land which is now being offered forms part of the employment allocation within the original scheme. Location Potton is a small but thriving historic market town of approximately 5000 residents situated in the north-eastern rural corner of Bedfordshire close to the border with Cambridgeshire. It is accessible to Cambridge, Bedford, Stevenage, Milton Keynes etc and is well served by the A1, A14 and A421 trunk roads. Main line stations on the east coast line from Sandy, Biggleswade and St Neots provide access into London Kings Cross in well under an hour. The historic Georgian Market Square at the heart of the Town provides a wide range of shops and services with the Town Library accommodated in the Clock House. Close by is a Tesco Express, McColl's, Doctors Surgery and Dentist. The Town also has much to offer in the form of community and sports facilities and activities with many of the latter (including Football, Cricket and Tennis Clubs) being provided at The Hollow which adjoins the development site. Services The site is to be offered on a fully serviced basis, with infrastructure to be constructed by Kier as part of the Tall Trees development. (NB: Kier will also be responsible for making up the levels of the site in accordance with the agreed finished levels). Viewing The site is currently being used as Kiers' site compound and accommodates the Site Manager's office etc. It will therefore be necessary for interested parties to request the co-operation and agreement of the Site Manager to gain access. Please contact Anne McGlinchey of Brown & Co Barfords on 10480 479072 to make an appointment. Other Access Kier has already constructed the new roundabout on Biggleswade Road to serve the overall development. The estate road and infrastructure to Phase I of the Tall Trees Scheme has been implemented. The main access road through the estate, which will serve the subject land, is to be completed during the second quarter of 2018. Terms As a result of a recent pre-application planning enquiry made to Central Bedfordshire Council, the potential for a care home scheme on part of the area designated for employment use has received a favourable response on the basis that this use will be an employment generator. An indicative site layout plan which was presented to the planning authority is reproduced within these particulars. This showed a scheme of 60 rooms within a three storey building. The planners expressed possible reservations about the scale of the structure but the principle of a new care home building was given in principle support. It should be noted that the site lies adjacent to the housing proposed by Kier Living and outside an odour contour which has been identified by Central Beds Council. Whilst the pre-application planning enquiry was positive in the context of the land shown edged red on the plans in these details, the Council is keen to see other employment generating opportunities to be accommodated on the adjoining land to the east which is shown edged blue on the plans. However, a positive indication was provided that in addition to the care home, some assisted living units might be supported alongside commercial accommodation on the adjoining land. The area of this additional land is 0.55 Ha (1.36 Acres) and this can be included in the sale if required subject to an acceptable combination of uses being identified.",,1.1,SG19 2LU,['https://brownandcocrm.agencypilot.com/crm/store/documents/other/1266234_qo1ylj93sybtlr6d.pdf'],Brown & Co,David Barford,,,01480 213811,,,,,2026-02-17,New

Natural boundaries of mature hedgerows and trees provide both privacy and an attractive rural setting. With direct access from Chantry Lane, the land connects smoothly to the local and regional road network. Its regular shape, manageable size, and limited physical constraints create an excellent opportunity for residential development. Planning Background The property lies within the jurisdiction of Stevenage Borough Council, as set out in the Stevenage Local Plan (2011-2031). Outline planning consent was granted on 9 September 2024 (Ref: 24/00196/OP) for up to five high-quality dwellings. Importantly, there are no affordable housing or Biodiversity Net Gain requirements, ensuring a straightforward planning pathway. The consent has been structured to provide design flexibility, enabling developers to finalise layouts, scale and style at Reserved Matters stage. This freedom means homes can be tailored to either traditional family living or more contemporary designs, depending on market. Time Limits Reserved Matters to be submitted within 3 years of outline permission Development must commence within 5 years of permission, or within 2 years of Reserved Matters approval (whichever is later) Reserved Matters Requirements Approval will be required for: Layout Scale Appearance Access Landscaping Pre-commencement conditions include: Construction Management Plan (vehicles, compounds, timings, access) Tree protection scheme Infrastructure details (roads, drainage, parking, turning) Prior to construction above slab level: Climate adaptation/efficiency measures Boundary treatments (walls, fences, gates) Landscaping and planting scheme Car parking with SuDS/permeable surfacing Additional requirements: EV charging: all parking spaces EV-ready before occupation Waste & cycle storage to be agreed and installed before occupation Ongoing landscaping maintenance (replacement of failed planting within 5 years) Rights, Easements and Restrictions The land is sold subject to and with the benefit of all public rights and private rights of way, light, drainage, overhead cable, and other easements and restrictions or obligations that exist whether the same are described in the particulars. Location Todds Green is a small, semi-rural settlement located near Stevenage in Hertfordshire. The area offers a balance of countryside surroundings and convenient access to key transport routes, including the A1(M) and A602. It is well placed for commuters, with nearby Stevenage railway station providing regular services to London Kings Cross (approximately 21 minutes) and Cambridge (approximately 40 minutes). Todd's Green maintains a quiet, village-style atmosphere with access to open green spaces and essential local amenities, offering a peaceful setting close to larger towns but surrounded by larger local towns such as Hitchin and Stevenage.

The Business Park houses a range of differing occupiers and is in close proximity to Aldi and Morrisons Supermarkets along with McDonalds, Costa and Tesco Express. Both sites lend themselves to commercial development, subject to planning permission, albeit the Lakeside site (Plot 1) is within Flood Zone 2. That said, there is good visibility and potential access from Somersham Road to the Lakeside Site. The other site (Plot 2) is bounded by office buildings on both sides but has a ready-made access point from the Business Park access road. We have provided initial planning advice to the Management Company, which advises that the subject site is in Flood Zone 1, but not subject to surface water flood risk. It should however be noted that the wider area to the West of Compass Point Business Park falls within Flood Zone 3 (including the main entrance on Stocks Bridge Way) and is subject to high surface water flood risk. Location St Ives is an attractive historic market town located on the banks of the River Ouse approximately 14 miles from Cambridge, 5 miles from Huntingdon and 20 miles from Peterborough. Steeped in history, the town is today an expanding commercial centre with a population of around 16,500 people. The town offers a diverse range of shopping facilities including top retail names, specialist stores, local retailers and a regular street market. The town also has a strong commercial base and has become an increasingly significant business location due to its accessibility to the national motorway network via the A14 dual carriageway, which links the East Coast ports to the West Midlands and North West. The area has also benefited from its proximity to Cambridge and has proved a popular choice for companies seeking to relocate from the city, particularly businesses in computers and research and development. There are fast train links to London from Cambridge and Huntingdon with a typical journey time of 50 minutes into Kings Cross from Huntingdon. There is a guided bus service from St Ives to Cambridge and the Park and Ride service is located at Meadow Lane, a short distance from the town centre and St Ives Business Park. The journey time from St Ives to Cambridge Science Park is circa 20 minutes. Services There are currently no services connected to the Lakeside site (Plot 1), but there is an electrical supply to Plot Two. Viewing Access to the sites will be available during daylight hours to applicants having first registered their interest with the agents. HEALTH & SAFETY Neither the seller nor the agent is responsible for the safety of those viewing the sites and accordingly do so at their own risk. VAT It is understood that VAT is applicable.

Chapel Street in Dunton, near Biggleswade, is a quiet residential lane comprising a mix of mid-century and modern homes, set within a traditional Bedfordshire village. The village benefits from a primary school, community facilities, and regular events such as the Dunton Wassail festival, fostering a strong sense of local identity. Recent infrastructure improvements, including school enhancements and infrastructural upgrades, have increased its appeal to families and professionals alike. With proximity to Biggleswade's amenities and train services, and ongoing residential development such as the Harvest Meadows site, Chapel Street presents an attractive blend of countryside charm and modern connectivity. Planning Permission CB/23/01779/FULL was granted on 20th May 2024 for 8 Chapel Street, Dunton, Biggleswade. The consent allows for the erection of two detached dwellings and associated works. Full planning permission has been granted, and the position on conditions is as follows: External materials: To be provided in line with the approved scheme as part of the development. Highway access and visibility splays: The relevant crossover to the shared access has already been addressed under the 2022 consent; the remaining works will be carried out in conjunction with this development. Turning area, parking, and refuse/cycle provision: To be delivered on-site in accordance with the approved layout during construction. Archaeological works: An initial survey has been undertaken. This revealed indications of a Roman ditch layout together with a possible Iron Age pit. No relics of significance were uncovered, other than very small shards of pottery. A further phase of investigation is required by Central Bedfordshire Council to clarify these elements. Fire safety: A domestic sprinkler/fire suppression system and fire hydrant will be installed as part of the build. Ecological enhancements: Bird, bat, and bee boxes, along with planting and habitat features, will be implemented as the development progresses. Tree protection and landscaping: Arboricultural measures and landscaping works will be carried out during construction, with a maintenance regime to follow. Construction and environmental compliance: Works will be undertaken in accordance with the Council's Codes of Practice once construction commences. The development will provide two detached residential dwellings with associated access, parking, landscaping, and ecological enhancements. At present, archaeological matters are ongoing, and the remaining conditions will be discharged as part of the construction phase. Once complete, the scheme will deliver a sustainable and well integrated addition to the village of Dunton. Access The development will be serviced by an established access point via Chapel Street, providing convenient and direct entry to the units. Mains foul drainage, water, electricity, and fibre broadband services are understood to be available in close proximity to the site. There is no mains gas supply to the village. Purchasers are advised to satisfy themselves as to the availability of such services and make their own enquiries with the relevant suppliers. However, infrastructure searches from the utility companies where available will be added to the Data Room. Data Room A Development Information Pack is available upon request containing relevant planning documentation, reports, surveys, plans and other relevant information. Rights, Easements and Restrictions The land is sold subject to all public rights and private rights of way, light drainage, overhead cable, and other easements and restrictions or obligations that exist whether the same are described in the particulars.

The Business Park houses a range of differing occupiers and is in close proximity to Aldi and Morrisons Supermarkets along with McDonalds, Costa and Tesco Express. Both sites lend themselves to commercial development, subject to planning permission, albeit the Lakeside site (Plot 1) is within Flood Zone 2. That said, there is good visibility and potential access from Somersham Road to the Lakeside Site. The other site (Plot 2) is bounded by office buildings on both sides but has a ready-made access point from the Business Park access road. We have provided initial planning advice to the Management Company, which advises that the subject site is in Flood Zone 1, but not subject to surface water flood risk. It should however be noted that the wider area to the West of Compass Point Business Park falls within Flood Zone 3 (including the main entrance on Stocks Bridge Way) and is subject to high surface water flood risk. Location St Ives is an attractive historic market town located on the banks of the River Ouse approximately 14 miles from Cambridge, 5 miles from Huntingdon and 20 miles from Peterborough. Steeped in history, the town is today an expanding commercial centre with a population of around 16,500 people. The town offers a diverse range of shopping facilities including top retail names, specialist stores, local retailers and a regular street market. The town also has a strong commercial base and has become an increasingly significant business location due to its accessibility to the national motorway network via the A14 dual carriageway, which links the East Coast ports to the West Midlands and North West. The area has also benefited from its proximity to Cambridge and has proved a popular choice for companies seeking to relocate from the city, particularly businesses in computers and research and development. There are fast train links to London from Cambridge and Huntingdon with a typical journey time of 50 minutes into Kings Cross from Huntingdon. There is a guided bus service from St Ives to Cambridge and the Park and Ride service is located at Meadow Lane, a short distance from the town centre and St Ives Business Park. The journey time from St Ives to Cambridge Science Park is circa 20 minutes. Viewing Access to the sites will be available during daylight hours to applicants having first registered their interest with the agents.

Sommerfeld & Thomas former warehouse - Comprising a Grade II listed 18th century warehouse. Works to complete repairs to the listed Sommerfeld and Thomas building and to remove a large 1950's steel portal framed building have been completed in 2023, leaving the building in a safe and secure state. This part of the property totals 0.17 Ha (0.41 acres). Title no. NK322916. Former Grain Silo Site - The area has been cleared, with the exception of the foundations of the silo bases. This part of the property totals 0.13 Ha (0.32 acres). Title no. NK318519. The property is bordered to the south by Devil's Alley, a historic path through to Nelson Street and South Quay. It is located near the town's medieval core that includes a Minster (origins 12th century) and streets with significant architectural heritage, including Hampton Court located directly to the east of the property. The area is popular with tourists and overlooks the River Great Ouse. Location The property is located in the market town of King's Lynn, overlooking the river Great Ouse on south Quay. South Quay is within walking distance of the King's Lynn centre. King's Lynn is host to a train station with direct links to both Cambridge and London King's Cross. The town is primarily accessed by road, mainly via the A47. The King's Lynn waterfront has been earmarked for regeneration, in policy 9.1.5 E1.8 KLR of The King's Lynn and West Norfolk Local Plan Review (2016-2036). The vision being that the property would provide the key to unlocking the waterfront's future potential, activating the area and leading to further regeneration. Accommodation The property has the following (approximate) gross internal/net internal floor area: Overall: sqm ( sqft) Business Rates Tenants are advised to contact the Local Authority in order to confirm the amount payable as the property may be eligible for some form of transitional relief.

Other The Borough Council of King's Lynn & West Norfolk seeks to invite proposals that will deliver the objectives for the property, set out below, and give confidence of deliverability. Comprehensive and complementary redevelopment of the property to deliver the wider regeneration ambition of the historic and currently underutilised waterfront in King's Lynn. Ensure development is delivered on the property and the borough council's objectives are met in a timely way. Bring to life a redundant part of the waterfront through the introduction of a range of uses, including commercial and leisure, that will attract new visitors, create a sense of place and, boost the town's nighttime and leisure economy. Retention and enhancement of historic Grade II listed Sommerfeld and Thomas warehouse building. Act as a catalyst for investment and development in the town centre and surrounding area. Enable the council to realise its investment in the property. To create a seamless and compelling interface with the provision of new public realm to the south of Devil's Alley (due to complete March 2026). Support wider vision and objectives of the Town Investment Plan and the wider programme of works benefitting from funding through the Towns Fund PLANNING POTENTIAL The property was allocated in the 2016 Property Allocations and Development Management Policies Plan as an area for potential residential development (Policy E1.8). In this allocation there was a preference for the retention of Devil's Alley and emphasises on the importance of sensitive design and massing. The property also features in The King's Lynn & West Norfolk Local Plan Review 2016 - 2036 (pre-stage submission 2021), Policy 9.1.5 E1.KLR. Although there is reference to residential uses in the allocation the borough council will strongly consider overarching policy E1. KLR which states the following uses would be widely acceptable for development across the Waterfront Regeneration Area: Residential Commercial/Offices Cultural Cafés/Restaurants Shops Community uses Open space Entertainment/Recreational/Leisure activities The property has been included within The King's Lynn and West Norfolk Local Plan Review (2016-2036) documentation as part of the waterfront regeneration area (Policy 9.1.5 E1 KLR). The policy has aspirations for a high calibre mixed use scheme that maximises the use of the brownfield elements of King's Lynn, utilises the potential of the river front area and increases the King's Lynn day and night time economies for both residents and tourists. PLANNING HISTORY Sommerfeld & Thomas former warehouse There is no planning history on this part of the property, other than the application to remove the steel portal framed building and make repairs to the warehouse. Former Grain Silo Site An application was submitted in 2006, for a 39 bedroom hotel and ancillary accommodation. Reference No. 06/01073/FM and 06/01074/CA. A further application for a mixed-use development was submitted by Landway Homes (King's Lynn) Ltd for 66 flats with ground floor space for offices, retail, a non-residential institutional use and assembly and leisure. This was submitted in June 2008 and subsequently withdrawn in August 2008. McCarthy & Stone submitted the most recent planning application on the Grain Silo Site in for 51 unit care home in 2014, planning was refused in the first instance and later granted at appeal. Reference No. 14/00534/FM. Town Investment Plan and Towns Fund The property has been identified as part of the Town Investment Plan, and will benefit from funding made available through the Towns Fund. The Towns Fund is providing resource to create a new public space and dryside facilities for the visitor pontoons on the site to the south of Devil's Alley and the borough council would invite bidders to propose ways in which this public investment could be enhanced and integrated into the redevelopment strategy for the property. Southern half of the Former Grain Silo Site This site lies to the south of the historic path known as Devil's Alley. The site has been cleared and totals 0.17 Ha (0.42 acres) and is owned freehold by the council. The site has been earmarked to provide a high-quality public realm area (the property is adjacent to the Millfleet) and is the focus of the Towns Fund funding. It is envisaged that this area could provide an opportunity for attracting footfall from the town centre and provide an avenue to the southern waterfront area where high quality outdoor (or partially covered) space could be used for informal food and drink/ street food/ temporary entertainment.

Its regular shape and level topography allow for flexible layout and design, including extensive landscaping, open space, and ecological enhancement areas. The site forms a natural extension to the village, bordered by existing homes to the south and west, while open countryside lies to the north and east, providing a sensitive rural backdrop. The combination of its location, topography, and boundaries ensures the scheme can deliver a well-designed and cohesive residential development that integrates with the existing village fabric. Services Electricity, water, drainage, and telecoms are understood to be available in proximity to the site. Other PLANNING An outline planning application was granted at appeal following non-determination by Rutland County Council. Consent allows for up to 30 dwellings, with access from Brooke Road approved and all other matters reserved for subsequent submission at the Reserved Matters stage. Key planning conditions include off-site highway works, visibility splays, ecological management, drainage, archaeology, construction management, landscaping, and estate road construction. These requirements are not untypical for sites of this nature and will be addressed as part of the Reserved Matters and pre-commencement approvals. S106, COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE LEVY (CIL), SELF-BUILD & HOUSING MIX The S106 agreement provides for 40% affordable housing, which equates to 12 dwellings. Provision includes both rented and intermediate tenure in line with Rutland County Council requirements. Additionally, the scheme includes at least two self-build or custom-build plots to support local housing diversity. Biodiversity Net Gain of 10% is required to be delivered onsite through ecological enhancement measures. The scheme is subject to Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) obligations at the standard residential rate of £143.75 per square metre in Rutland, effective from 1st January 2025. OVERAGE Offers are required to include a provision for overage which is expected to be linked to coverage, GDV and/or unit numbers, as well as any S.106 contribution or affordable housing reductions. Proposals for overage are invited and should be set out within the submitted offer. ACCESS Access to the site is confirmed from Brooke Road, with visibility splays to be provided as part of the Reserved Matters submissions. Off-site highway improvements include the construction of a 2m footway linking the site to Lammas Close, widening of Brooke Road, and relocation of the 30mph speed limit. The Transport Statement advises that the proposed development would generate only a small number of additional vehicle trips during peak periods, which would not materially affect the local highway network. RIGHTS OF WAY There are no recorded public rights of way crossing the site, though access to the surrounding countryside is readily available via local footpaths and the adjacent lanes. The layout allows for integration of pedestrian links to the village and adjacent properties, enhancing connectivity for residents and reinforcing the site's role as a natural village extension. BOUNDARIES The southern and western boundaries are defined by existing residential properties, creating a clear sense of enclosure. Hedgerows and occasional mature trees along the edges of the site provide natural screening. The northern and eastern boundaries open to rural farmland, giving the site a strong relationship with the surrounding landscape. These boundary conditions allow for both visual integration with the village and opportunities for landscaping and biodiversity enhancements. LOCAL AUTHORITY Rutland County Council.

The FEP's Local Development Order status provides full planning permission for qualifying uses, enabling swift establishment and expansion of businesses on the site. Situated to the west of Norwich at Honingham, near Easton, the FEP immediately adjoins the A47, one of the main transport routes in the region linking Norwich to King's Lynn and Peterborough to the west, and provides easy access to London and Cambridge via the recently dualled A11 and M11. The historic city of Norwich has an urban population of 213,000 (2011 Census) and offers an outstanding quality of life, with the stunning coastline, historic towns and Norfolk Broads all within easy reach. The Government is implementing a £200m programme of improvements to the A47, including the dualling of the single carriageway section between North Tuddenham and Easton. The upgrade works are currently under construction and will create direct access to the site with a new roundabout. Journey times to and from the site will be significantly improved. Plot ABC extends to 12.24 acres and can be taken as a whole or on a split basis from c. 2 acres.

The approved scheme permits 151 dwellings, a new roundabout and access from Biggleswade Road, an area of employment land, a site for a community hall, and public open space. The main residential part of the overall site was purchased by Kier Living and the development of Kier's ""Tall Trees"" scheme is now well underway. See https://www.kierliving.co.uk/potton_tall-trees-14255. The site is located less than half a mile from Potton town centre and its picturesque Market Square. With a net developable area of 0.45 ha (1.1 acres) the land which is now being offered forms part of the employment allocation within the original scheme. Location Potton is a small but thriving historic market town of approximately 5000 residents situated in the north-eastern rural corner of Bedfordshire close to the border with Cambridgeshire. It is accessible to Cambridge, Bedford, Stevenage, Milton Keynes etc and is well served by the A1, A14 and A421 trunk roads. Main line stations on the east coast line from Sandy, Biggleswade and St Neots provide access into London Kings Cross in well under an hour. The historic Georgian Market Square at the heart of the Town provides a wide range of shops and services with the Town Library accommodated in the Clock House. Close by is a Tesco Express, McColl's, Doctors Surgery and Dentist. The Town also has much to offer in the form of community and sports facilities and activities with many of the latter (including Football, Cricket and Tennis Clubs) being provided at The Hollow which adjoins the development site. Services The site is to be offered on a fully serviced basis, with infrastructure to be constructed by Kier as part of the Tall Trees development. (NB: Kier will also be responsible for making up the levels of the site in accordance with the agreed finished levels). Viewing The site is currently being used as Kiers' site compound and accommodates the Site Manager's office etc. It will therefore be necessary for interested parties to request the co-operation and agreement of the Site Manager to gain access. Please contact Anne McGlinchey of Brown & Co Barfords on 10480 479072 to make an appointment. Other Access Kier has already constructed the new roundabout on Biggleswade Road to serve the overall development. The estate road and infrastructure to Phase I of the Tall Trees Scheme has been implemented. The main access road through the estate, which will serve the subject land, is to be completed during the second quarter of 2018. Terms As a result of a recent pre-application planning enquiry made to Central Bedfordshire Council, the potential for a care home scheme on part of the area designated for employment use has received a favourable response on the basis that this use will be an employment generator. An indicative site layout plan which was presented to the planning authority is reproduced within these particulars. This showed a scheme of 60 rooms within a three storey building. The planners expressed possible reservations about the scale of the structure but the principle of a new care home building was given in principle support. It should be noted that the site lies adjacent to the housing proposed by Kier Living and outside an odour contour which has been identified by Central Beds Council. Whilst the pre-application planning enquiry was positive in the context of the land shown edged red on the plans in these details, the Council is keen to see other employment generating opportunities to be accommodated on the adjoining land to the east which is shown edged blue on the plans. However, a positive indication was provided that in addition to the care home, some assisted living units might be supported alongside commercial accommodation on the adjoining land. The area of this additional land is 0.55 Ha (1.36 Acres) and this can be included in the sale if required subject to an acceptable combination of uses being identified.",,1.1,SG19 2LU,['https://brownandcocrm.agencypilot.com/crm/store/documents/other/1266234_qo1ylj93sybtlr6d.pdf'],Brown & Co,David Barford,,,01480 213811,,,,,2026-02-17,New

Benefiting from rail links to London Kings Cross (typical journey time of 50 minutes), the town has seen a considerable expansion of its commerce and industry in recent years. It also enjoys excellent road communications with London and the east coast ports, being located at the intersection of the A1 trunk road and the A428/A421 Cambridge-Bedford M1-Milton Keynes route. The opening of the A14 (A1/M1 link) in 1997 has also significantly improved accessibility to the Midlands and the North West. The town has a good range of shopping facilities with many national multiple retailers represented, including Boots, Waitrose, Fat Face and a Marks & Spencer Simply Food.

The Retail element of the property comprises 15 individual Retail Units of varying sizes, some of which have their own WC facilities, the remainder having shared use of communal WC facilities for the tenants concerned accessed off the covered walkway. Some of the Retail Units have ancillary accommodation at First Floor level. The 5 Residential Flats are all situated at First and Second levels and comprise 3x 2 bedroom Flats and 2x 1 bedroom Flats. One Flat is currently vacant and requires internal refurbishment works offering the potential to add further rental income. North Kesteven District Council have aspirations to construct a pedestrian foot bridge which will link Bristol Arcade over the River Slea to Money's Yard and the proposed Town Centre Cinema / Leisure scheme to potentially be constructed on an adjacent site. This should significantly enhance footfall to Bristol Arcade. The property also offers further development opportunities to the new owner as some currently vacant properties, including a 2-storey detached structure overlooking the River Slea, could be redeveloped for a wide variety of uses to include Restaurant / Café, subject to the relevant planning consents being obtained. Location Sleaford is an established Market Town in the centre of the County of Lincolnshire having a resident population of approximately 20,000 people and offering excellent road communication links via the A15 and A17 Trunk Roads and with the Cathedral City of Lincoln being approximately 18 miles to the North.

The Business Park houses a range of differing occupiers and is in close proximity to Aldi and Morrisons Supermarkets along with McDonalds, Costa and Tesco Express. Both sites lend themselves to commercial development, subject to planning permission, albeit the Lakeside site (Plot 1) is within Flood Zone 2. That said, there is good visibility and potential access from Somersham Road to the Lakeside Site. The other site (Plot 2) is bounded by office buildings on both sides but has a ready-made access point from the Business Park access road. We have provided initial planning advice to the Management Company, which advises that the subject site is in Flood Zone 1, but not subject to surface water flood risk. It should however be noted that the wider area to the West of Compass Point Business Park falls within Flood Zone 3 (including the main entrance on Stocks Bridge Way) and is subject to high surface water flood risk. Location St Ives is an attractive historic market town located on the banks of the River Ouse approximately 14 miles from Cambridge, 5 miles from Huntingdon and 20 miles from Peterborough. Steeped in history, the town is today an expanding commercial centre with a population of around 16,500 people. The town offers a diverse range of shopping facilities including top retail names, specialist stores, local retailers and a regular street market. The town also has a strong commercial base and has become an increasingly significant business location due to its accessibility to the national motorway network via the A14 dual carriageway, which links the East Coast ports to the West Midlands and North West. The area has also benefited from its proximity to Cambridge and has proved a popular choice for companies seeking to relocate from the city, particularly businesses in computers and research and development. There are fast train links to London from Cambridge and Huntingdon with a typical journey time of 50 minutes into Kings Cross from Huntingdon. There is a guided bus service from St Ives to Cambridge and the Park and Ride service is located at Meadow Lane, a short distance from the town centre and St Ives Business Park. The journey time from St Ives to Cambridge Science Park is circa 20 minutes.

Help and Assistance: If you have any questions or require any clarification as to the online auction process please contact the auctioneer prior to commencement of the bidding window as we will be unable to enter into any discussions once the auction has started. Bidding Process: Prior to bidding the bidder will complete a Passport-to-Bid process, which requires registration, verification and agreement to Buyers Terms. How To Follow the Auction: Use 'Watch' button to follow the auction. If you register to Watch an auction you will receive email notifications of any bidding activity on the specific lot. How It Works: Unconditional Timed Auction Online: This is a binding method of sale similar to a traditional public property auction. The only difference is the bidding takes place online. The successful purchaser will be required to pay a 10% deposit (subject to a minimum payment of £5,000) on the fall of the virtual gavel and contracts will be exchanged. Bidding for properties online works in a similar fashion to eBay. You can place bids using your PC, tablet or mobile phone and the minimum amount you can bid is defined by the 'bid increment' level. When you place a bid, the property listing page will show you if your bid was successful and whether or not you are the highest bidder. When you are the highest bidder on a property, if another bidder outbids you the system will notify you by email so that you can place another bid if you wish. The major difference from eBay is that our system eradicates sudden death 'bid sniping' through the use of auction 'extension times'. If you have any questions or require any clarification please contact the auctioneer.

Historically the property comprised two parcels, as described below. The council expects bidders to deliver both parcels together as part of a comprehensive redevelopment of the property. Sommerfeld & Thomas former warehouse - Comprising a Grade II listed 18th century warehouse. Works to complete repairs to the listed Sommerfeld and Thomas building and to remove a large 1950's steel portal framed building have been completed in 2023, leaving the building in a safe and secure state. This part of the property totals 0.17 Ha (0.41 acres). Title no. NK322916. Former Grain Silo Site - The area has been cleared, with the exception of the foundations of the silo bases. This part of the property totals 0.13 Ha (0.32 acres). Title no. NK318519. The property is bordered to the south by Devil's Alley, a historic path through to Nelson Street and South Quay. It is located near the town's medieval core that includes a Minster (origins 12th century) and streets with significant architectural heritage, including Hampton Court located directly to the east of the property. The area is popular with tourists and overlooks the River Great Ouse. Location The property is located in the market town of King's Lynn, overlooking the river Great Ouse on south Quay. South Quay is within walking distance of the King's Lynn centre. King's Lynn is host to a train station with direct links to both Cambridge and London King's Cross. The town is primarily accessed by road, mainly via the A47. The King's Lynn waterfront has been earmarked for regeneration, in policy 9.1.5 E1.8 KLR of The King's Lynn and West Norfolk Local Plan Review (2016-2036). The vision being that the property would provide the key to unlocking the waterfront's future potential, activating the area and leading to further regeneration. Accommodation The property has the following (approximate) gross internal/net internal floor area: Overall: sqm ( sqft) Business Rates Tenants are advised to contact the Local Authority in order to confirm the amount payable as the property may be eligible for some form of transitional relief. Viewing Strictly by appointment with the Selling Agent. VAT Awaiting Confirmation. Legal Costs Each party will be responsible for their own legal costs incurred in documenting the sale. Other The Borough Council of King's Lynn & West Norfolk seeks to invite proposals that will deliver the objectives for the property, set out below, and give confidence of deliverability. Comprehensive and complementary redevelopment of the property to deliver the wider regeneration ambition of the historic and currently underutilised waterfront in King's Lynn. Ensure development is delivered on the property and the borough council's objectives are met in a timely way. Bring to life a redundant part of the waterfront through the introduction of a range of uses, including commercial and leisure, that will attract new visitors, create a sense of place and, boost the town's nighttime and leisure economy. Retention and enhancement of historic Grade II listed Sommerfeld and Thomas warehouse building. Act as a catalyst for investment and development in the town centre and surrounding area. Enable the council to realise its investment in the property. To create a seamless and compelling interface with the provision of new public realm to the south of Devil's Alley (due to complete March 2026). Support wider vision and objectives of the Town Investment Plan and the wider programme of works benefitting from funding through the Towns Fund PLANNING POTENTIAL The property was allocated in the 2016 Property Allocations and Development Management Policies Plan as an area for potential residential development (Policy E1.8). In this allocation there was a preference for the retention of Devil's Alley and emphasises on the importance of sensitive design and massing. The property also features in The King's Lynn & West Norfolk Local Plan Review 2016 - 2036 (pre-stage submission 2021), Policy 9.1.5 E1.KLR. Although there is reference to residential uses in the allocation the borough council will strongly consider overarching policy E1. KLR which states the following uses would be widely acceptable for development across the Waterfront Regeneration Area: Residential Commercial/Offices Cultural Cafés/Restaurants Shops Community uses Open space Entertainment/Recreational/Leisure activities The property has been included within The King's Lynn and West Norfolk Local Plan Review (2016-2036) documentation as part of the waterfront regeneration area (Policy 9.1.5 E1 KLR). The policy has aspirations for a high calibre mixed use scheme that maximises the use of the brownfield elements of King's Lynn, utilises the potential of the river front area and increases the King's Lynn day and night time economies for both residents and tourists. PLANNING HISTORY Sommerfeld & Thomas former warehouse There is no planning history on this part of the property, other than the application to remove the steel portal framed building and make repairs to the warehouse. Former Grain Silo Site An application was submitted in 2006, for a 39 bedroom hotel and ancillary accommodation. Reference No. 06/01073/FM and 06/01074/CA. A further application for a mixed-use development was submitted by Landway Homes (King's Lynn) Ltd for 66 flats with ground floor space for offices, retail, a non-residential institutional use and assembly and leisure. This was submitted in June 2008 and subsequently withdrawn in August 2008. McCarthy & Stone submitted the most recent planning application on the Grain Silo Site in for 51 unit care home in 2014, planning was refused in the first instance and later granted at appeal. Reference No. 14/00534/FM. Town Investment Plan and Towns Fund The property has been identified as part of the Town Investment Plan, and will benefit from funding made available through the Towns Fund. The Towns Fund is providing resource to create a new public space and dryside facilities for the visitor pontoons on the site to the south of Devil's Alley and the borough council would invite bidders to propose ways in which this public investment could be enhanced and integrated into the redevelopment strategy for the property. Southern half of the Former Grain Silo Site This site lies to the south of the historic path known as Devil's Alley. The site has been cleared and totals 0.17 Ha (0.42 acres) and is owned freehold by the council. The site has been earmarked to provide a high-quality public realm area (the property is adjacent to the Millfleet) and is the focus of the Towns Fund funding. It is envisaged that this area could provide an opportunity for attracting footfall from the town centre and provide an avenue to the southern waterfront area where high quality outdoor (or partially covered) space could be used for informal food and drink/ street food/ temporary entertainment.

Having been in the ownership of the Vendors for 283 years, Wormingford Hall was formerly part of the Wormingford Manor which was owned by Waldegrave family between circa 1393 and 1702. Historically the Mere and part of the surrounding land formed a Deer Park and was the site of a Hunting Lodge. Overlooking the Stour Valley, Wormingford Hall Estate provides a prospective purchaser with a rare opportunity to acquire an equipped commercial farm with excellent sporting potential in a highly sought-after part of Essex. LOCATION & SITUATION Wormingford Hall Estate is situated on the north and western edges of the village of Wormingford, just over 2 miles south-east of the village of Bures, 5 miles north-west of the village of West Bergholt and 7 miles north-west of the city of Colchester. Both Wormingford and Bures were included in the Domesday Book and provide local amenities such as public houses, churches, post offices, sports facilities and the Bures Primary School, rated ""Good"" by Ofsted. Further afield, West Bergholt, Colchester and Sudbury provide a more extensive range of shops and amenities. The railway station at Bures, via Marks Tey Station, provides links to London Liverpool Street (approx. 1hr 15m) and Colchester (approx. 30m) with the nearby A12 also providing road links to the wider region. There are excellent schools locally in both the state and independent sectors - St Helena School, The Stanway School and Colchester Royal Grammar School, as are the independent Littlegarth School, Gosfield School, The Ryes College and Felsted School. DESCRIPTION The Estate comprises the attractive 8-bed Grade II Listed Hall, a 3-bed bungalow, a pair of semi-detached bungalows, a 3-bed detached dwelling, a 3-bed detached prefabricated bungalow, an extensive range of farm buildings with scope for conversion (STPP), agricultural land and the Mere. The property extends to a total of approximately 651.92 acres (263.82 hectares). WORMINGFORD HALL Wormingford Hall, situated adjacent to the farmyard, enjoys an elevated position overlooking the Stour Valley. First documented in 1267, The Hall is Grade II Listed with its current construction dating back to the 16th Century with mid-19th Century neo-Jacobean details.

FARMYARD The main farmyard comprises an extensive range of traditional and modern buildings which are suitable for conversion, subject to planning. Further buildings, including a large general-purpose building are located to the south of the main farmyard, adjacent to the arable land. A full schedule of the buildings and plans can be obtained from the Selling Agents. LAND The Estate comprises 390.03 acres (157.83 hectares) of arable land, 206.99 acres (83.77 hectares) of grassland, 36.44 acres (14.76 acres) of woodland and the 6.43-acre (2.61 hectare) Wormingford Mere. The land effectively lies in a single block conveniently divided into four by the B1508 and Church Road, off which there are various access points to each block with some good road frontage. The land is primarily classified as Grade 2, with a seam of Grade 3 running east to west through the property, predominantly where the grassland is situated. A number of the arable fields benefit from comprehensive under drainage with plans available upon request. The land is defined by the Soil Survey of England & Wales as being predominantly of the Hornbeam 3 and Ludford Soil Associations, with the land adjacent to the River Stour of the Fladbury 1 Soil Association. The arable land has been farmed both in-hand and under seasonal cropping licences. The in-hand farming has been undertaken through a Contract Farming Agreement. The current Contractor may be interested in continuing with this arrangement subject to agreeing terms with a Purchaser. The arable land has been farmed in a rotation that consists of winter wheat, sugar beet, onions, potatoes, rye and AD maize. The full cropping history for the last 5 years is available from the Selling Agents. The root crops have been grown under seasonal cropping licences with the growers providing their own water for crop irrigation via the Vendors two underground irrigation mains that run under parts of the holding. There are no abstraction licences on the Estate and no water for the irrigation of crops is included within the sale. Please contact the Selling Agents for further details. Whilst areas of grassland surround the hall and farmyard, the majority of the grassland is situated in one block between the B1508 and River Stour. The land is grazed by cattle on seasonal grazing licences. Adding to the sporting opportunity the grassland has undulations and valleys which, paired with the existing areas of woodland, would create some impressive drives. Wormingford Mere is a natural feature, fed by springs, which is joined into the River Stour by a small cut. The Mere has previously been the focus of research undertaken by Cambridge University and the Colchester Archaeological Group in relation to its age and depth. Now the Mere is utilised by a local angling society by agreement with the owners. For further information please contact the Selling Agents.

It comprises part brownfield and part greenfield land, the former being the Mellor Metals scrap metal recycling yard and the latter pasture land. The site is generally flat other than for a gentle slope west to east. The western frontage of the site comprises four existing dwellings which are to be retained by the owners, although they could be made available by separate negotiation. Location The site is situated on the eastern edge of Great Ellingham, on the north side of the B1077 Attleborough Road. Great Ellingham is 2.50 miles North West of Attleborough, 12 miles from Dereham and approx. 17 miles south west of the City of Norwich. The site is a semi-rural location less than 1.70 miles from the A11 trunk road. Accommodation The property is freehold and vacant possession will be given according to an agreement relating to the cessation of the Mellor Metals site after completion. Services Mains electricity, a mains water supply and mains drainage are available on site. Viewing Viewing is by appointment only through this office. VAT VAT is likely to be charged on the purchase. Other CIL There is no C.I.L chargeable in relation to this site under the terms of the existing planning permission. DISPUTES Should any dispute arise as to the boundaries or any point arising in these particulars, schedule, plans or interpretation of any of them the question shall be referred to the arbitration of the Selling Agent, whose decision acting as expert shall be final. The buyer shall be deemed to have full knowledge of all boundaries and neither the seller nor the seller's agents will be responsible for defining the boundaries or the ownership thereof. HEALTH AND SAFETY Viewers should be careful and vigilant whilst on the site of which part is an operational metal recycling plant. Access is available by appointment. Neither the seller nor the selling agents are responsible for the safety of those viewing the property without accompaniment and accordingly those viewing the property do so at their own risk. Terms The site benefits from outline planning permission for up to 75 dwellings granted on the 7th April 2017 from Breckland District Council under reference 3PL/2016/0648/O. All other matters are reserved. The proposed net density amounts to 25 dwellings per hectare including the existing four dwellings. The concept is for a single point of vehicular access, integration of walking and cycle links, public open space and a variety of housing types, sizes and tenure. AFFORDABLE HOUSING The current proportion of affordable housing proposed is consistent with Breckland Council's affordable housing policyat 40%. The mix is 65% rented and 35% intermediate housing. The Local Authority has previously discussed viability, although the Valuation Office on their behalf confirmed 40% to be appropriate. The owners are currently undertaking detailed intrusive contamination and ground surveys with which to enter more informed discussions and we hope to identify a preferred bidder to engage with the process to add value and work up a detailed scheme. Although the principle bid should be in accordance with the permission, to assist with the decision it would be helpful to receive alternative bids at various revised levels of affordable housing; assuming 30%, 20% and 10%.

It is bordered by mature hedging where it fronts Gowthorpe Lane and Main Road. There is also hedging and mature trees to the south of the site providing a natural boundary between the land and the neighbouring properties. Location The land is a corner site, north of the village, with road frontage onto Main Road and Gowthorpe Lane, Swardeston. The village of Swardeston lies to the south of Norwich off the A47 southern bypass. The village is connected by the B1113, which connects into the A140 giving direct access to the centre of Norwich some 4.5 miles to the north. Viewing VIEWING AND FURTHER INFORMATION The land can be viewed from the roadside. However, should any party wish to access the land they may do so on foot only, with a copy of the particulars to hand. No vehicular access will be allowed. Contact: Nick Dawes Tel: 01476 514433 Mob: 07768 465725 Email: nick.dawes@brown-co.com VAT The guide price quoted in these particulars of sale is exclusive of VAT. It is understood that the land is not currently elected to charge VAT although the vendor's reserve the right to do so prior to any sale. Other PLANNING The land falls within the planning jurisdiction of South Norfolk Council. The current adopted Local Plan identifies this land as SWA1, and refers to Policy 15 of the Joint Core Strategy identifying Swardeston as a Service Village in which land will be allocated for small scale housing growth during the period 1st April 2008 to 31st March 2026. Policy SWA1, Land on Main Road, Swardeston The site lies to the south-east of the junction between Main Road and Gowthorpe Lane. The land amounts to some 2.7 hectares (6.67 acres) is allocated for housing and associated infrastructure. This allocation could accommodate approximately 30 dwellings reflecting density and development elsewhere in the village. The development of this site is required to ensure the following: a) Historic environment records to be consulted to determine any need for archaeological survey prior to development. b) Norfolk Minerals and Waste Core Strategy Policy CS16 applies as this site is underlaid by safeguarded mineral resources. c) Waste-water infrastructure capacity must be confirmed prior to any development taking place and this should include sustainable urban drainage systems. CARE HOME USE The vendors preference is for the site, or part of it to be used for a Care Home provision. No direct discussions have been had with Planning Officers with regard to a Care Home provision on the site, however, it is believed that this use type would be compatible with its residential allocation. RESIDENTIAL DENSITY The site allocation has a stated number of houses of up to 30 dwellings. Although no direct discussion has been had with the Local Planning Authority it is expected that they would be prepared to consider a higher density in view of the wider pressure for housing delivery. LAND EDGED BLUE ON THE PLAN The land edged blue has a countryside allocation and is in the same ownership as the land edged red. Access to this land will be retained via a right through the allocated land for the benefit of future development. The vendors are open to proposals for an Option Agreement on this land in favour of the purchasers of the allocated element. ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION In accordance with the most recent Anti Money Laundering Legislation, buyers will be required to provide proof of identity and address to the selling agent once an offer has been submitted and accepted (subject to contract) prior to solicitors being instructed. Terms METHOD OF SALE Interested parties should make their own enquiries direct with the Local Planning Authority whether that be for a care home or residential use or a mixture of the two. Although the vendors preference is for some form of care home either on all or part of the site, they are open-minded and also interested in schemes that are purely for residential development. It is proposed that the allocated land will be sold on a conditional contract, subject to planning basis, with the purchase price having been agreed in advance of entering into the conditional contract.",,6.6,,['https://brownandcocrm.agencypilot.com/crm/store/documents/other/468331_828zy893t59m49hl.pdf'],Brown & Co,Nick Dawes,,,07768 465725,,,,For Sale,2026-02-17,New

Located to the south west of the growing market town of Long Stratton the land offers prospective purchasers the opportunity to acquire a significant strategic development opportunity, subject to an existing promotion agreement. LOCATION & SITUATION The land borders the town of Long Stratton to the north and east with extensive road frontage along the A140 to the east which provides easy access to Norwich, Diss, Wymondham and Attleborough where there are rail links to London and Cambridge. The Cathedral city of Norwich is situated approximately 13 miles to the north which offers extensive shopping, and leisure facilities. What3words reference: ///loaning.uttering.royal DESCRIPTION The property comprises an attractive block of primarily commercial arable land with a small parcel of grass to the north west. The fields are bordered by hedges and trees with a network of internal tracks and some infield ponds and trees. The land is classified as Grade 3 by the Provisional Agricultural Land Classification Sheet and identified as being part of the Brockhurst 1, Gresham, Sustead series which is typically loamy: coverloam over till. mostly suited to a combinable cropping rotation. Access to the property is directly from Flowerpot Lane or the A140. There is access to the southwest corner from the Green Lane/Byway along the western edge, although this is unsuitable for heavy agricultural equipment. TOWN & COUNTRY PLANNING & PROMOTION AGREEMENT The Greater Norwich Local Plan was adopted in March 2024 with 1,800 houses or thereabouts allocated for development as part of a scheme to deliver a Long Stratton bypass. While parts of the land at Flowerpot Lane may suit an early application if the Local Authority struggles with non-delivery of housing over the next few years, it is likely that the main Long Stratton development will provide the allocated numbers for the village for some time. Thereafter, the land at Flowerpot Lane would appear suitable and sustainable, subject to planning permission being granted. The bypass has planning permission and is due to start imminently. The presence of the bypass which connects with the A140 immediately at the southeast corner of the land means that as well as good access from Flowerpot Lane, we anticipate improved access to the south eastern side of the land direct from the current A140. The purchaser/s will be deemed to have full knowledge and have satisfied themselves as to any planning matters that may affect the property. South Norfolk District Council are the relevant authority. The land is included in a promotion agreement to Rosconn Developments dated 10th June 2022. Further details are available from the selling agent. GENERAL REMARKS & STIPULATIONS METHOD OF SALE The property is offered for sale by private treaty as a whole. If a prospective purchaser is interested in any part of the property, they are invited to discuss their requirements with the selling agent. TENURE AND POSSESSION The property is offered for sale freehold. The property is let under an Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 Agreement dated 2nd March 2004 from 11th October 2003 until 11th October 2031. AGENTS NOTE The vendors will seek a deed of overage whereby 30% of any increase in value following the grant of any planning permission or other approval under the Town & Country Planning Acts for anything other than agricultural or equestrian use shall be paid. The overage will run for 30 years from the date of the conveyance and will be payable on implementation of a planning consent/approval or sale of this property with the benefit of the planning permission/approval.

Since planting the first vines over a decade ago, owners John and Bridget Hemmant have followed the motto ""Audax at Fidelis"" which means ""Bold but Faithful"". Taking bold strides in technique and the use of varieties but remaining faithful to the skills prevalent in the making of good wine. This approach has served them well with National and International recognition for many of the wines including the House of Hemmant Blanc De Noirs Brut. VINEYARD & LAND The vines cover approximately 18 acres, planted in 2.4m spacings on metal trellis to optimise light and air flow. The land is gently undulating and is cropped with both red and white grape varieties including Solaris, Pheonix, Schonberger, Seyval blanc, Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, Cabernet Noir, and Regent. There is also an additional parcel of land providing further opportunity for expansion. The majority of the vines are between 8 and 15 years old, in fruit, offering maturity and a long useful life remaining. The land is mostly classified as Grade 3, with small pockets of grades 2 and 4. The soils are described as slightly acid loamy and clayey soils with some lighter sandy soils above gravel.

The Hall was home to former wartime NFU President in 1942, Kit Nevile. To the west of the Hall and gardens are a range of former traditional brick farm buildings which have some development potential, subject to the necessary consents and being mindful of the need to be sympathetic to the Grade II listed Hall. The Hall enjoys thoughtfully planted gardens offering year round colour through a variety of shrubs and flowers. There are formal gardens to the south which include a patio and ponds as well as a kitchen garden and two greenhouses. The north side of the Hall has a more natural feel and is carpeted with snowdrops, crocus and daffodils in the spring. On this side there is also an orchard which provides plums, pears, apples, raspberries, gooseberries, fig, cherry and peach. The yard includes several buildings which continue to be used for farming the land. There is a grazing licence on the grass fields until 1st September 2025 after which vacant possession will be available on these fields. The Hall is lotted with the grass paddocks surrounding it, to the north, south and east. To the west of the Hall, there is an orchard with views overlooking the adjoining farmland. The total area of this grassland is 10.08 hectares (24.93 acres). It can be accessed either off Thorpe Road or through the yard. All three grazing fields have access to a private water supply. Accommodation The Hall has well proportioned accommodation including 5 bedrooms, 6 reception rooms and 3 bathrooms. Outside there is a double garage together with a range of brick outbuildings which adjoin the traditional farm buildings in the yard. The Hall is Grade II listed, under list entry number 1061963. Whisby Hall is accessed off Thorpe Road along an inviting private driveway leading to ample parking space next to the Hall. The Hall can also be accessed on foot through the entrance to the yard. Viewing Viewings of the farm will be by appointment only through the Seller's Agent. Access to view inside the dwellings will be permitted, subject to genuine interest. Top House is occupied and viewing will be subject to tenant availability. No unauthorised access is allowed into any of the dwellings or farm yards.

The property is accessed directly off The Nook Road and is bound to the south by Burton Brook. PLANNING There was a historic planning permission granted by Harborough District Council on 19th June 2009 for the demolition of two existing dwellings and associated outbuildings and the erection of two detached dwellings. (Planning Reference: 09/00432/FUL) The planning permission was never implemented. We have also recently obtained informal pre-planning advice from Harborough District Council for the erection of four dwellings and the planning officer concluded that the development was unlikely to be acceptable due to flood risk. The Vendors have not at this stage commissioned any reports or surveys to verify their findings. All prospective purchasers are to make their own enquiries with the local planning authority and satisfy themselves in respect of the development potential of the site. This property is freehold with vacant possession. Location The property is located approximately 4 miles from Kibworth Village, 6 miles from Leicester City Centre and 9 miles to the M1. Services There are no known services connected to this property. Viewing Viewing is strictly by appointment only and should be arranged with the selling agent. VAT Should any sale of the property as a whole or in lots or any right attached become a chargeable supply for the purpose of VAT, such tax shall be payable by the Purchaser in addition to the contract price. Other Overage The property will be sold with overage for any development and this will apply to residential, commercial and renewable energy projects. The rate will be 30% for 35 years from the completion date and payable on the grant of a planning consent. The demolition of the two existing dwellings and replacement of two new dwellings will not trigger the overage.",,1.33,LE8 9GQ,['https://brownandcocrm.agencypilot.com/crm/store/documents/other/1474388_eg6p6w92v6c1riw2.pdf'],Brown & Co,Thomas Bland,,,07443 690871,,,Freehold,For Sale,2026-02-17,New

Chapel Street in Dunton, near Biggleswade, is a quiet residential lane comprising a mix of mid-century and modern homes, set within a traditional Bedfordshire village. The village benefits from a primary school, community facilities, and regular events such as the Dunton Wassail festival, fostering a strong sense of local identity. Recent infrastructure improvements, including school enhancements and infrastructural upgrades, have increased its appeal to families and professionals alike. With proximity to Biggleswade's amenities and train services, and ongoing residential development such as the Harvest Meadows site, Chapel Street presents an attractive blend of countryside charm and modern connectivity. Planning Permission CB/23/01779/FULL was granted on 20th May 2024 for 8 Chapel Street, Dunton, Biggleswade. The consent allows for the erection of two detached dwellings and associated works. Full planning permission has been granted, and the position on conditions is as follows: External materials: To be provided in line with the approved scheme as part of the development. Highway access and visibility splays: The relevant crossover to the shared access has already been addressed under the 2022 consent; the remaining works will be carried out in conjunction with this development. Turning area, parking, and refuse/cycle provision: To be delivered on-site in accordance with the approved layout during construction. Archaeological works: An initial survey has been undertaken. This revealed indications of a Roman ditch layout together with a possible Iron Age pit. No relics of significance were uncovered, other than very small shards of pottery. A further phase of investigation is required by Central Bedfordshire Council to clarify these elements. Fire safety: A domestic sprinkler/fire suppression system and fire hydrant will be installed as part of the build. Ecological enhancements: Bird, bat, and bee boxes, along with planting and habitat features, will be implemented as the development progresses. Tree protection and landscaping: Arboricultural measures and landscaping works will be carried out during construction, with a maintenance regime to follow. Construction and environmental compliance: Works will be undertaken in accordance with the Council's Codes of Practice once construction commences. The development will provide two detached residential dwellings with associated access, parking, landscaping, and ecological enhancements. At present, archaeological matters are ongoing, and the remaining conditions will be discharged as part of the construction phase.

The road and civic amenity facility is on a lease to Tarmac until 2048 with rights reserved to share use of the road with farm traffic. The lease grants the right for the tenant to grant a sub-lease to LincWaste to use the civic waste facility and the haul road for access. That sublease to LincWaste commenced on 16th October 1998 and terminates 31st July 2048, in line with the head lease. The tenant can break the lease by giving 6 months notice on the civic waste site and by giving 6 months notice on the haul road, following completion of the quarry workings at Whisby. The lease is contracted out of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 security of tenure provisions. The current rent passing of £34,626.00 per annum represents an attractive income stream secured for a number of years with scope for increase, being index linked. It is also subject to any additional permitted uses of the road and verge being agreed. Further details of the lease and rent receivable under the lease are available from the data room on request to the Seller's Agent. At the north end of the road is a former waste disposal site formerly occupied by Lincolnshire County Council. The lease on this compound has now ended. We understand this was a recycling facility and as such are not aware of any contamination. This area has a permit for landfill issued in May 2005 which was reviewed and reissued in 2016. The verges are a minimum of 2 metres and are included with the road. Rights will be reserved for use of the road by the Buyer of Lot 3, if sold in lots. There have been negotiations to extend the permitted use of the road under the lease in return for a capital sum. The Seller has not concluded the negotiation. This leaves an unopened opportunity for a Buyer. Further details on the nature of this negotiation can be discussed with the Seller's Agent.

Its regular shape and level topography allow for flexible layout and design, including extensive landscaping, open space, and ecological enhancement areas. The site forms a natural extension to the village, bordered by existing homes to the south and west, while open countryside lies to the north and east, providing a sensitive rural backdrop. The combination of its location, topography, and boundaries ensures the scheme can deliver a well-designed and cohesive residential development that integrates with the existing village fabric. Services Electricity, water, drainage, and telecoms are understood to be available in proximity to the site. Other PLANNING An outline planning application was granted at appeal following non-determination by Rutland County Council. Consent allows for up to 30 dwellings, with access from Brooke Road approved and all other matters reserved for subsequent submission at the Reserved Matters stage. Key planning conditions include off-site highway works, visibility splays, ecological management, drainage, archaeology, construction management, landscaping, and estate road construction. These requirements are not untypical for sites of this nature and will be addressed as part of the Reserved Matters and pre-commencement approvals. S106, COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE LEVY (CIL), SELF-BUILD & HOUSING MIX The S106 agreement provides for 40% affordable housing, which equates to 12 dwellings. Provision includes both rented and intermediate tenure in line with Rutland County Council requirements. Additionally, the scheme includes at least two self-build or custom-build plots to support local housing diversity. Biodiversity Net Gain of 10% is required to be delivered onsite through ecological enhancement measures. The scheme is subject to Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) obligations at the standard residential rate of £143.75 per square metre in Rutland, effective from 1st January 2025. OVERAGE Offers are required to include a provision for overage which is expected to be linked to coverage, GDV and/or unit numbers, as well as any S.106 contribution or affordable housing reductions. Proposals for overage are invited and should be set out within the submitted offer. ACCESS Access to the site is confirmed from Brooke Road, with visibility splays to be provided as part of the Reserved Matters submissions. Off-site highway improvements include the construction of a 2m footway linking the site to Lammas Close, widening of Brooke Road, and relocation of the 30mph speed limit. The Transport Statement advises that the proposed development would generate only a small number of additional vehicle trips during peak periods, which would not materially affect the local highway network. RIGHTS OF WAY There are no recorded public rights of way crossing the site, though access to the surrounding countryside is readily available via local footpaths and the adjacent lanes. The layout allows for integration of pedestrian links to the village and adjacent properties, enhancing connectivity for residents and reinforcing the site's role as a natural village extension. BOUNDARIES The southern and western boundaries are defined by existing residential properties, creating a clear sense of enclosure. Hedgerows and occasional mature trees along the edges of the site provide natural screening. The northern and eastern boundaries open to rural farmland, giving the site a strong relationship with the surrounding landscape. These boundary conditions allow for both visual integration with the village and opportunities for landscaping and biodiversity enhancements. LOCAL AUTHORITY Rutland County Council. VAT It is understood that VAT will not be payable on the sale. However, if the sale of the land or any rights attached to it become chargeable for VAT this shall be paid by the purchaser. LEGAL COSTS Each party is responsible for their own costs. LAND REGISTRY The property is freehold. The land is offered for sale by the owners, with all relevant title information available in the Data Room. METHOD OF SALE The property is offered for sale via informal tender.

With shaded walkways throughout the formal enclosed and private grounds which provide trees, shrubs and plants that would challenge many botanical gardens in the region, The Hill also provides opportunity and the space for a new owner to either continue the past years use since construction in 1992 as a very private and unique residence, or to re-model or develop to a boutique hotel to capture the location and tropical environment St Lucia and the Hill offer.",,,,[],Brown & Co,Caribbean office,,,001 758 451 6151,,,,,2026-02-17,Old
