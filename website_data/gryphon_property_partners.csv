Berlage, the foremost Dutch architect of the 20th Century. It was commissioned and built for Wm. H.Müller & Co - a Dutch company involved in shipping mining. 
 Each floor has a cross shaped lobby completely clad with mosaics and tiles of remarkably geometric design leading to the office areas. The lobbies and the public areas are the result of the collaboration between the architect Berlage and the artist Bart Van Der Leck where the clearly expressed steel structure of the building combines with the beautiful stained glass windows and the wonderful glass lanterns . The beautiful paneled suites and meeting rooms on the first floor have been made from the mahogany stripped from one of Wm. H. Muller’s ships from the early part of the century. 
 It has been a serviced office since 2007 when 4 of the floors were taken over and a comprehensive restoration took place of the listed common areas and refurbishment of the office areas. There are onsite staff who run the reception and a management team who look after the building to allow you to concentrate on your business. 

                             Holland House is located opposite the Gherkin Piazza on the east side of the piazza on Bury Street and within a 5 minute walk of Liverpool Street Station.  Lloyds of London and many City Institutions are just minutes away.
