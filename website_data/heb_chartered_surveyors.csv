LOCATION The two plots of land are situated approximately two miles northeast of the centre of Mansfield, bounded by the Mansfield Woodhouse, Forest Town and Clipstone suburbs of the town. The area has proved popular with house builders, with the recent Crown Gardens (Gleeson Homes), Regency Grange (Persimmon) and The Acorns (Stancliffe Homes) developments in close proximity. Mansfield has an estimated population of 111,000 persons, and is located approximately 12 miles north of Nottingham , 20 miles southeast of Sheffield, 16 miles northeast of Derby and 26 miles west of Lincoln. The catchment area includes the towns of Sutton in Ashfield (36,500 population) and Kirkby in Ashfield (25,000 population) amongst other towns and suburbs comprising the larger built-up area. Mansfield is situated immediately east of the M1 motorway (Junctions 27 & 28). Mansfield is served by two train stations including the Mansfield Woodhouse station, a short distance from the sites. SITE DESCRIPTION Two separate fields (held under single title), offering a superb opportunity to secure strategic edge of settlement land with significant future development potential. Both fields are currently tenanted for agricultural purposes, and have the approximate areas stated. The sites are currently accessed via Peafield Lane (A6075) and New Mill Lane (at the junction with Clipstone Drive and Clipstone Road East) respectively. Intending purchasers are to make their own enquiries with regards to ongoing and future access and highways provisions. The areas stated below exclude any road, tracks and paths around field perimeters. PLANNING Both fields are presently in agricultural use. We consider the land to have excellent strategic prospects for future development. Both sites have been submitted to the local authority under the December 2024 Mansfield Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment (HELAA) call for sites, forming part of the evidence base for the Mansfield District Local Plan Review (commenced 2023). We believe that the land has potential through the local plan process to meet any special strategy requiring future housing to be focused within the urban area on sustainable sites adjacent to the town. We have already had a number of approaches from site promotors and others seeking options, which we consider indicative of the land's planning gain potential. Masterplan Feasibility studies (2022) for each site are available in the data room for reference purposes (without warranty). The indicative designs indicate that massing may allow for 677 and 378 dwellings respectively, should future planning permissions allow (provided for indicative guidance purposes only, and without warranty). TENURE Freehold, subject to the existing tenancy. The tenancy is a yearly periodic tenancy, Under the 1986 Agricultural Holdings Act. A copy of the tenancy, local Searches and report on title will be made available in the data room. VAT Not Applicable. NOTE The land is offered for sale on behalf of the Joint Administrators Sherwood Oak Holdings Limited. The Administrators offer no title or collateral warranties associated with the portfolio.
