They are sold along with a range of buildings and stables and the traditional stone barns, which are ripe for development. Further details of which can be found in these particulars. The lot includes land and steading, with the full site extending to approximately 74.15Ac (30.01Ha). Holiday Cottages Barforth Hall is sold with the benefit of four stone fronted cottages which are unrestricted, but are currently let for holiday use. These comprise of two, three bedroom semi detached bungalows and two, one bedroom semi detached bungalows. All properties benefit from their own private parking and front and rear private gardens, with a wood fired hot tub to each property. The holiday cottages are currently let for holiday use, and would also be suitable for an AST, or as a private dwelling. They could also both be easily converted to two larger bungalows, each enjoying a flexible floorplan. Barns for Development Adding to the character and appeal of the estate are the traditional stone-built barns, which offer a total area of 222.83m². Situated opposite the Hall the barns are situated in a horseshoe with private gardens. These historic buildings exude charm and present a rare opportunity for conversion to residential or holiday accommodation, subject to the necessary planning consents. Their potential for transformation, combined with their architectural merit, adds a valuable layer of opportunity for a buyer with vision. While there is currently no planning permission in place, there has previously been planning granted which has now lapsed. Land and Buildings Barforth Hall is an exceptional rural estate, offering a unique blend of agricultural productivity, breathtaking natural beauty, and tremendous potential for lifestyle, sporting, and diversification ventures. The property is set within a private, ring-fenced landscape that combines the charm of traditional English countryside with the functionality of a modern working farm. At the heart of the estate lies a selection of both traditional and modern agricultural buildings, providing immense versatility for a wide range of uses. The modern buildings are predominantly steel portal framed with block, timber or sheet cladding, encompassing an impressive total gross area of 2,430.90m², ideal for machinery storage, livestock housing, or grain handling. A real standout is the purpose-built indoor horse arena, featuring a quality sand surface, alongside well-appointed stabling and tack rooms, creating an ideal environment for equestrian training, private use, or a potential commercial venture. The land itself is a rich and varied tapestry of fertile, high-yielding arable fields, permanent pasture, mature woodland, and stunning parkland. Approximately 67.88 acres are dedicated to productive arable cultivation, with 19.35 acres of versatile grassland suitable for grazing or haymaking. A further 27.76 acres of woodland not only contributes to the estate’s visual appeal but also enhances biodiversity and privacy. The estate’s celebrated parkland, extending to 34.01 acres, is bordered by a spectacular stretch of the River Tees, with around 10.66 acres of river and riverbank adding to the idyllic setting. The boundaries are defined by a combination of traditional hedgerows and secure post-and-wire fencing, enclosing the land in a harmonious, well-managed whole. Sporting Opportunities Barforth Hall offers a wealth of sporting potential. The undulating land, natural cover, and existing woodland create the perfect setting for establishing a pheasant and partridge shoot, ideal for those seeking a small-scale, high-quality sporting estate. The grounds lend themselves beautifully to the creation of bespoke drives and release pens, with natural topography that enhances the sporting experience. Diversification Opportunities Few estates offer such a compelling canvas for diversification. The blend of traditional and modern buildings, exceptional equestrian facilities, and the historic charm of the setting open a wide range of potential business ventures. From developing holiday accommodation such as holiday cottages or luxury glamping sites, to establishing a commercial equestrian centre or creating canvas for diversification. The blend of traditional and modern buildings, exceptional equestrian facilities, and the historic charm of the setting open a wide range of potential business ventures. From developing holiday accommodation such as holiday cottages or luxury glamping sites, to establishing a commercial equestrian centre or creating an exclusive wedding or events venue, the possibilities are considerable and exciting. One of the estate’s most intriguing features is the remains of St Lawrence’s Chapel, a Grade II listed monument located along the approach to the Hall. This atmospheric relic of the deserted medieval village of Barforth enhances the estate’s historical significance and could form a unique focal point in any future tourism or heritage-led enterprise. Just 100 metres to the north, the historic Dovecot, a fine example of traditional estate architecture, adds further charm and character to this extraordinary setting. Nearby, nature reveals one of Barforth Hall’s hidden treasures, a picturesque waterfall cascading over a steep cliff edge, offering a truly breathtaking spectacle as the water tumbles through ancient woodland. With panoramic views of the river and a historic three-arched stone bridge, the location has all the ingredients for an unforgettable visitor experience. Environmental Land Management Barforth Hall is not currently enrolled in any environmental stewardship schemes, offering a blank canvas for buyers interested in engaging with the government’s Environmental Land Management (ELM) schemes. The estate is ideally placed to benefit from a range of future environmental initiatives, from biodiversity enhancement and agroforestry to capital infrastructure projects that promote sustainable farming and conservation. With its mix of woodland, grassland, river frontage, and arable land, the estate could readily support ambitious, forward-thinking land management strategies that align environmental goals with economic returns.

The exterior is a wonderful example of Victorian and Gothic architecture. Internally the owner has been faithful to the building's heritage and historical past, carefully renovating the striking oculus window and the restored alter, and integrating elements required for a comfortable modern life. A first floor mezzanine level has been installed with two double bedrooms and stylish en-suite facilities. Every detailed element has been considered with specific attention given to the stained glass windows, handmade bespoke staircase made from the original Church pews, exposed arched beams, decorative coving, handmade cast iron lighting, ironmongery and arched window frames. The accommodation has underfloor heating on the ground floor, a bespoke oak kitchen with a full suite of integrated appliances, three bedrooms and three bathrooms, as well as a large private patio area to the rear. Due to the exceptional nature of the conversion the Church has featured in Caroline Quentin's Derelict Rescue and since completion has successfully been in high demand as a unique holiday let business. The Accommodation The property is approached via the original Church front door, into an entrance lobby with Victorian tiled flooring. An inner door opens into the large reception room which boasts a wealth of period charm and original features. Upon entering the room, a raised plinth made from the original Church pews leads in turn to the bespoke handmade staircase with Italian wrought iron spindles.
