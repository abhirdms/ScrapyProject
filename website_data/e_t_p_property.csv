We are instructed to quote a guide price of £475,000, excl. VAT. Conditional offers upon planning for storage uses / servicing will be considered. Description- The site comprises approximately 0.78 acres (0.316 ha) of cleared ground, forming part of the former Brislington Rail Station which was closed in the 1960s. Access to the site from Talbot Road is via two tarmac accessways running parallel with the northern and southern boundaries. Planning – The wider site has most recently been used as a scrapyard (a sui generis planning use). Historic records indicate that scrapyard use was authorised at part of the southern area of the site (not forming part of the site for sale) via a Certificate of Lawful Use granted in February 1993 (ref: 92/02695/C). We are not aware of any planning decision explicitly authorising scrapyard use across the site as a whole. Interested parties are advised to make their own enquiries with the local planning authority to understand the scope for alternative uses, however, we consider the site lends itself to most open storage uses, subject to planning consent. The site is considered suitable for open storage uses and possibly other forms of development, although applications for residential development and uses with permanent structures have previously been rejected. Offers conditional upon planning may be considered dependent upon terms. Interested parties are advised to contact Bristol City Council’s Planning department on 0117 922 3000 for further information. Services – The site is un-serviced at present, although we are advised an electricity supply can be brought onto site from Talbot Road.
