The city is located at the very heart of the UK, with Birmingham 18 miles to the south east, Manchester 66 miles to the north and London 127 miles to the south east. Wolverhampton is also at the centre of the country’s infrastructure platform. The city is served by the M6, M6 Toll and M54 motorways, which further connect with the M5, M42, M40 and M1, providing excellent connectivity with the national motorway network. The town’s main arterial roads are the A41 which leads south east towards Birmingham and north west into Shropshire. The A460 and A449 lead north towards the M54 (Junctions 1 and 2 respectively) and south towards Dudley. Junctions 1 & 2 of the M54 are 4 miles to the north and Junction 10 of the M6 is 5 miles to the east. Wolverhampton Railway Station is served by the West Coast Mainline with a journey time to Birmingham New Street of 20 minutes and London Euston of 1 hour 40 minutes, also with direct rail connections to Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow. The city centre is served by Line 1 of the Midland Metro Rapid Transport Network, providing connections to West Bromwich and Birmingham city centre.

DESCRIPTION St Mary’s Abbey has a history dating back to the 18th Century. It was built in 1750 by Mr. Charles Cope Trubshaw who subsequently sold it in 1791 to Mr. Charles Selleck Brome. At this time, it was known as “The Mount” and extended over three floors with Georgian architectural features. In 1828 the property was purchased by the Rt. Hon Robert William Shirley, Viscount Tamworth who subsequently altered the property introducing the Gothic features which are apparent today. The Benedictine Community acquired the property in 1835 and carried out further modifications including the creation of a beautiful church and an accommodation wing rebuilt in the 1970’s. The Abbey is predominately constructed of stone with slate roofs with some brick and rendered sections. The “new wing” is constructed of brick under a tile roof. To the rear of the Abbey is a private burial ground with a Mortuary Chapel. The buildings are set in landscaped grounds enclosed by high brick walls most of which are thought to date from the mid-19th Century. The Abbey, Mortuary Chapel and the boundary brick wall that encloses the site are all Grade II listed.

Full planning permission was granted by the previous Montgomeryshire District Council in 1994 for the “ erection of 10 dwellinghouses and formation of vehicular access ” under application reference M23449. This planning permission was accompanied by a Section 106 Agreement dated 16th May 1994 and requires that t wo of the houses have a local occupancy restriction. The planning permission was subsequently renewed on 17th December 1998 under application reference M98842 with the following description: “Erection of 10 dwellinghouses and formation of vehicular access (renewal of permission M23449) at Land adjoining Penybont Farm, Maes Curig, Llangurig” Copies of the planning permission and Section 106 are available from the selling agents.

The above works mean that the 1998 planning permission is extant i.e. “live”.
