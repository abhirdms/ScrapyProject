The site benefits from proximity to Cargo First’s rapidly expanding freight operations and the airport’s extensive infrastructure. Suitable for a range of uses including industrial, logistics, or aviation-related occupiers, the site presents strong potential for investors and developers seeking growth in one of the UK’s fastest-emerging cargo and business gateways. Manchester Airport Group has sought pre application advice (available in data room) from BCP Council for the demolition of existing buildings, enabling works and site clearance, construction of employment floorspace (Use Class B8 including ancillary office provision), associated access, parking, landscaping and other ancillary works. The development proposal for Site 4 consists of 2 new industrial units. The proposed Unit 1 scheme is 30,139 sq ft (2,800 sq m) and proposed Unit 2 scheme is 58,190 sq ft (5,405 sq m), both with 10% office content at first floor. Bournemouth International Airport Northern Business Park (which includes Site 4) is allocated as a strategic higher quality employment site under Policy PC1, demonstrating future development of the land for employment uses within B1, B2 and B8 will be supported by the Council.  Location: Strategically located on Aviation Business Park adjacent to Bournemouth Airport. The Park is just off the A338 Spur Road, providing fast links to Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch, with direct access to the A31/M27 for Southampton, Portsmouth and London. Home to an established cluster of aviation, logistics and industrial occupiers, the Business Park benefits from the airport’s expanding passenger and cargo operations, making it a prime location for industrial development. Bournemouth Airport is currently benefitting from £60 million of investment. This comes as the airport reported its best-ever cargo year to March 2025, handling 31,000 tonnes of freight—almost double the previous year’s 18,000 tonnes. The surge has elevated Bournemouth to the 8th busiest cargo airport in the UK. The most active operators at the airport are Cargo First and European Cargo.  Highlights: Unrivalled opportunity to acquire a 6.5 acre development site at Bournemouth Airport, offering Development and Investment opportunities in a supply constrained market In close proximity to Bournemouth International airport, benefitting from exposure to 31,000 tonnes of annual freight movements with continued forecast growth (April 2025). Positive pre app for a two unit scheme consisting of a 30,139 and 58,190 sq ft warehouse. Short term contracted income producing an annual rent of £128,300, allowing for continued asset management in advance of development.
