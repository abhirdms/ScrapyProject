Mynytho has a population of 1,400 (2021 Census) and a population of approximately 8,000 within a 5 mile radius. In addition, there is considerable increase due to tourism in the Gwynedd region amounting to some 7.81 million visitors a year generating £1.3 Billion and employing 15,000 within the sector (Welsh Tourism board 2024). Historically these visitors were predominantly confined to the Summer but in more recent years they have become more evenly spread throughout the year. Abersoch is well known as a tourist destination with corresponding high property prices which has resulted in many of the town's old established hotels giving way to new residential development. As a result, it is now considered that there is a shortage of modern hotel accommodation in the area and the proposed development at Murmur Y Mor is an opportunity to provide some much needed purpose built accommodation. There are no other public houses in Mynytho and there is an opportunity here to provide something individual with stunning views, adjacent to a busy road with easy access throughout the Llyn Peninsula.
