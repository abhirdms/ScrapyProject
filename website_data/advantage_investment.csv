The Chocolate Factory boasts an incredible history that dates back to 1881 when it first opened its doors as a confectionery production site. For decades, it was the heart and soul of Bristol’s sweet industry, producing beloved treats enjoyed by generations. For 100 years, the Chocolate Factory has stood at the heart of the Green Bank community, making world-renowned chocolates. After more than a decade of lying empty and unused, the much-anticipated regeneration of this iconic Bristol site, rich in history and heritage, is now underway. The historical legacy adds a unique charm and character to the development, making it a truly special place to be a part of. Situated in the Green Bank area of Bristol, the Chocolate Factory benefits from an enviable location. It’s just a short distance from the bustling city centre, with excellent transport links, including easy access to the M32 and frequent bus services. The cycle path located directly adjacent to the site provides an excellent link to the city centre, just a 10-minute cycle to the CBD and a 4-minute cycle to Eastgate Shopping Centre. This prime location ensures high demand for both renters and buyers, guaranteeing strong capital appreciation and rental yields. The development offers a blend of modern living with a touch of historical charm, featuring a range of beautifully designed apartments and townhouses. The Chocolate Factory caters to diverse lifestyles, with luxury amenities including a state-of-the-art gymnasium, central courtyard, and dedicated working spaces. These features make it an attractive choice for professionals, families, and retirees alike. With a limited supply of new homes in Bristol and a growing population, the Chocolate Factory represents a unique investment opportunity. Bristol’s housing market has seen consistent growth, with house prices increasing by 8% over the past year alone. This trend is expected to continue, with rental growth forecast at 24.6% over the next 5 years. Now is the perfect time to invest in this prestigious development. The rental market in Bristol is booming, and the Chocolate Factory is set to capitalise on this trend. Rental prices in the city have increased by 12.9% year-on-year, driven by high demand and limited supply. Investors can expect strong rental yields of up to 7% for their properties at the Chocolate Factory. Bristol’s economy is thriving, with projections of 9% growth over the next 5 years. The city is a hub for tech, creative industries, and professional services, attracting top talent and creating numerous job opportunities. Investing in the Chocolate Factory means tapping into this market with a robust economy and growing workforce, ensuring a secure and profitable investment. The redevelopment of the Chocolate Factory is part of a broader regeneration effort in the Green Bank area. This transformation is bringing new life to the community with additional infrastructure, shops, cafes, and cultural spaces. Investing here means being part of a vibrant, growing community that values its heritage while looking forward to a bright future. With its unique historical charm, prime location, modern amenities, and strong investment potential, the Chocolate Factory is a development like no other. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to invest in a piece of Bristol’s rich history while securing a lucrative future.",,,BS5 6HP,[],Advantage Investment,,,,,,,,For Sale,2026-02-20,Old
