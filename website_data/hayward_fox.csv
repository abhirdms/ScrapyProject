The beach is a hive of activity in the summer with windsurfers, kite surfers, kayakers and paddle boarders, and swimmers also enjoying the sandbar at low tide. This traditional village is a secret haven of character and charm with its lively centre based around the Village Green offering a first-class range of shops, restaurants, pubs and cafes, as well as local amenities including a greengrocer, butchers, fishmongers, two general stores, a medical centre and a dental surgery. The Village Green is home to several events during the year, including an Arts & Music Festival, May Fair, Dog Show and Christmas Carol Service, with the Community Centre and the four village churches running busy programmes throughout the year. Walks can be enjoyed along the sea wall towards the popular market town of Lymington and the tranquil hamlet of Keyhaven as a perfect place to stop and enjoy views towards the Isle of Wight, Hurst Castle and the Needles. The walk from Keyhaven and Milford along Hurst Spit to the castle dating back to Tudor Times, is a must. To the west you can walk to Barton-on-Sea and enjoy the views across to Christchurch Bay, Hengistbury Head and the Purbeck Hills beyond. Milford-on-Sea has beautiful walks through sheltered woodland in the local Nature Reserves of Studland Common and the Pleasure Grounds as well as Sturt Pond. The New Forest National Park, only a short drive away, covers an area of 566 square kilometres and is made up of vast tracts of unspoilt woodland, heathland and river valleys where deer, ponies and cattle continue to roam free.

EVERTON AND THE LOCAL AREA Everton is a popular, pleasant village, enjoying a strong community spirit and with the benefit of a comprehensive post office/village store, church, social club, recreation ground with children's play area plus a village pub/restaurant. Everton is located midway between the towns of Lymington and New Milton which are only 3 miles away, and which provide easy access by British Rail to the larger shopping centre of Southampton and the seaside resort of Bournemouth, both of which have airports for domestic and international flights. The New Forest village of Brockenhurst also provides a fast train service direct to London Waterloo. In addition, Milford on Sea is approximately 1.5 miles from Everton and is a thriving coastal village boasting a long shingle beach, lined with colourful beach huts and stunning unspoilt views across the Solent. The beach is a hive of activity in the summer with windsurfers, kite surfers, kayakers and paddle boarders, and swimmers also enjoying the sandbar at low tide. This traditional village is a secret haven of character and charm with its lively centre based around the Village Green offering a first-class range of shops, restaurants, pubs and cafes, as well as local amenities including a greengrocer, butchers, fishmongers, two general stores, a medical centre and a dental surgery. The Village Green is home to several events during the year, including an Arts & Music Festival, May Fair, Dog Show and Christmas Carol Service, with the Community Centre and the four village churches running busy programmes throughout the year. Walks can be enjoyed along the sea wall towards the popular market town of Lymington and the tranquil hamlet of Keyhaven as a perfect place to stop and enjoy views towards the Isle of Wight, Hurst Castle and the Needles. The walk from Keyhaven and Milford along Hurst Spit to the castle dating back to Tudor Times, is a must. To the west you can walk to Barton-on-Sea and enjoy the views across to Christchurch Bay, Hengistbury Head and the Purbeck Hills beyond. Milford-on-Sea has beautiful walks through sheltered woodland in the local Nature Reserves of Studland Common and the Pleasure Grounds as well as Sturt Pond. The New Forest National Park, only a short drive away, covers an area of 566 square kilometres and is made up of vast tracts of unspoilt woodland, heathland and river valleys where deer, ponies and cattle continue to roam free. Clear rivers and shady groves provide tranquillity and a car-free haven for walking, cycling and horse riding.

To the first floor, a good-sized landing leads to all bedrooms. The principal bedroom benefits from a range of fitted wardrobes and a well-appointed en-suite shower room. There are three further generous bedrooms, served by a family bathroom. A particular feature of the property is the potential for a self-contained annexe, ideal for a dependent relative, guest accommodation, or home office. Located over the garage and accessed via a separate staircase, this area includes a large bed-sitting room, shower room, and its own independent access. Outside, the property enjoys a brick-paved driveway providing ample off-street parking for two to three vehicles, with additional space suitable for a dinghy or RIB. Double gates offer further access to the rear garden, which is of a good size for a modern development and benefits from a south-easterly aspect. The garden is laid predominantly to artificial lawn for ease of maintenance, enclosed by clearly defined fencing and enhanced by a mature oak tree. In our opinion, this is a particularly generous garden for a property of this type. The property is ideally positioned within Lymington, within easy reach of the vibrant High Street and the scenic Lymington River, renowned for its marinas, yacht clubs, and sailing facilities. The surrounding area offers an exceptional lifestyle, with the open spaces of the New Forest National Park close by, providing miles of walking, cycling, and riding across heathland and ancient woodland. Lymington’s excellent range of independent shops, cafés, restaurants, and weekly market, together with strong transport links and access to the Solent, combine to make this a highly desirable coastal and country location.

EVERTON AND THE SURROUNDING AREA Everton is a popular, pleasant village, enjoying a strong community spirit and with the benefit of a comprehensive post office/village store, church, social club, recreation ground with children's play area plus a village pub/restaurant. Everton is located midway between the towns of Lymington and New Milton which are only 3 miles away, and which provide easy access by British Rail to the larger shopping centre of Southampton and the seaside resort of Bournemouth, both of which have airports for domestic and international flights. The New Forest village of Brockenhurst also provides a fast train service direct to London Waterloo. In addition, Milford on Sea is approximately 1.5 miles from Everton and is a thriving coastal village boasting a long shingle beach, lined with colourful beach huts and stunning unspoilt views across the Solent. The beach is a hive of activity in the summer with windsurfers, kite surfers, kayakers and paddle boarders, and swimmers also enjoying the sandbar at low tide. This traditional village is a secret haven of character and charm with its lively centre based around the Village Green offering a first-class range of shops, restaurants, pubs and cafes, as well as local amenities including a greengrocer, butchers, fishmongers, two general stores, a medical centre and a dental surgery. The Village Green is home to several events during the year, including an Arts & Music Festival, May Fair, Dog Show and Christmas Carol Service, with the Community Centre and the four village churches running busy programmes throughout the year. Walks can be enjoyed along the sea wall towards the popular market town of Lymington and the tranquil hamlet of Keyhaven as a perfect place to stop and enjoy views towards the Isle of Wight, Hurst Castle and the Needles.

Everton is located midway between the towns of Lymington and New Milton which are only 3 miles away, and which provide easy access by British Rail to the larger shopping centre of Southampton and the seaside resort of Bournemouth, both of which have airports for domestic and international flights. The New Forest village of Brockenhurst also provides a fast train service direct to London Waterloo. In addition, Milford on Sea is approximately 1.5 miles from Everton and is a thriving coastal village boasting a long shingle beach, lined with colourful beach huts and stunning unspoilt views across the Solent. The beach is a hive of activity in the summer with windsurfers, kite surfers, kayakers and paddle boarders, and swimmers also enjoying the sandbar at low tide. This traditional village is a secret haven of character and charm with its lively centre based around the Village Green offering a first-class range of shops, restaurants, pubs and cafes, as well as local amenities including a greengrocer, butchers, fishmongers, two general stores, a medical centre and a dental surgery. The Village Green is home to several events during the year, including an Arts & Music Festival, May Fair, Dog Show and Christmas Carol Service, with the Community Centre and the four village churches running busy programmes throughout the year. Walks can be enjoyed along the sea wall towards the popular market town of Lymington and the tranquil hamlet of Keyhaven as a perfect place to stop and enjoy views towards the Isle of Wight, Hurst Castle and the Needles. The walk from Keyhaven and Milford along Hurst Spit to the castle dating back to Tudor Times, is a must. To the west you can walk to Barton-on-Sea and enjoy the views across to Christchurch Bay, Hengistbury Head and the Purbeck Hills beyond.
