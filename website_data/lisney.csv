The Boat House is ideally located on Bishop Street, just off Aungier Street right on the border of Dublin 2 and Dublin 8.

This location provides an ideal opportunity for office occupiers to establish themselves in a convenient city centre location. The building is easily accessible by public transport with the Luas at St Stephens Green or Harcourt Street just a short walk away. Numerous regular bus routes also serve the immediate area while Pearse Street DART is a 20-minute walk away.

Additionally it includes enjoying a sea-front position in the heart of the Connemara Gaeltacht on Ireland’s west coast, among the wild, rugged beauty of the ‘Wild Atlantic Way’. The course is distractingly beautiful with breathtaking views of Cill Chiaráin Bay, Cnoc Leitir Móir and Cnoc Mordáin mountain and with ocean inlets and rocky outcrops providing wily natural hazards. Set within circa 56-acres [22.7-hectares] it, includes a linked island and a natural harbour.
This charming course offers a unique golfing experience with traditional Connemara stone walls marking out the boundary and magnificent vista of rugged land and sea. The design purposely embraces the wild setting, with undulating fairways and greens magically positioned within the beautifully rugged landscape, optimizing the ocean front position and phenomenal panoramic scenic vistas. A causeway bridge links to a small island and the 3rd green, the 4th hole and 5th fairway. Furthermore, ruinous pre-famine cottages bound the sixth green.
Designed and constructed as a nine-hole layout in 1993 by Tom Craddock and Pat Ruddy, notable designer of The European Club and others, the course at Connemara Isles encapsulates all that is good about old fashioned golf played in stunning surroundings. It is a 9-hole course with 18 tee boxes, measuring 5,260 yards per-70 with a standard scratch of 67 and a course record of 63. Ruddy notes in his book “Holes in my Head” that while small, it is full of character and joy. It sets out “hole measurements of this delightful island hopper of a course which are 323, 354, 159, 270, 412, 165, 284, 481 and 186 for a total of 2634 yards for nine and just 5,268 for 18 holes”.
The seaside clubhouse incorporates the thatched ancestral home of the founders. Their great grandfather constructing it in 1850 when he returned from America as one of the survivors of the ill-fated Brig St. John famine ship that perished on the rocks near Boston Harbour in Cape Cod in 1849. The thatched house now purposed as a delightful bar within the clubhouse, replete with an open turf fire and linking to an extension added to provide a function room, an office, catering kitchen, toilets and changing rooms. An unexecuted plan to create a roof-top sea-front terrace would be amazing. It is the only thatched clubhouse in Ireland. Golf aside, the clubhouse has the potential to be, or incorporate, a phenomenal private coastal home. 3,702 square feet or 344 square metres [approx.].
Connemara Isles is situated at Annaghvane in Ceantar na nOileán, or the Island District, on the northwestern edge of Galway Bay. It’s an archipelago of low-lying islands characterised by dry stone walls and a patchwork of small rocky fields. A causeway bridge links to the mainland from the adjacent village of Bealadangan (Béal an Daingin). Amenities include a pub, a post office and a primary school. The sea around Connemara Isles is famous for its natural oyster and scallop beds and uncommonly there are seaweed harvesting rights. Traditional boating festivals in the Summer include heritage ‘Galway Hooker’ and Currach racing classes. The area offers a unique opportunity to experience wild Irish Connemara culture at its finest. The club has formed a fun and congenial social hub for locals and visitors alike.
Located a 1-hour drive west of Galway city, the juxtaposition of the lively Atlantic Ocean and the quiet scenic vista of bogs, valleys and lakes and patchwork fields of Connemara is incredibly appealing. Irish (Gaeilge) is the everyday spoken language but locals easily switch to English (often peppered with Irish phrases). Here is a treasure house of all that is best in rich Irish heritage, culture and folklore, where people still sing and dance in the old traditional manner.
Galway city 1 hour drive (29 miles, 47 km), Shannon Airport is 2 hours drive (85 miles, 138 km), Dublin airport 3 hours drive (158 miles, 256 km).",,,H91EF95,[],Lisney,,,,,,,,For Sale,2026-02-20,New

The hotel features 25 individually styled bedrooms, along with a welcoming bar, elegant lounge, and versatile dining and function spaces. Guests also enjoy access to a compact leisure facility, including a swimming pool and gym.
The main building is predominantly two-storey, complemented by a series of single-storey extensions to the rear. The original structure showcases traditional brick, stone, and masonry construction, while the extensions are built from concrete block with a smooth rendered finish. The property is topped with a series of pitched and hipped natural slate roofs, with flat roofs over the single-storey rear sections.
Inside, flooring is mainly timber-on-joist, and the original building retains its classic timber-framed windows with single-pane glazing, enhanced by modern PVC-framed double-glazed windows in the newer extensions.
Occupying a central position on its site, the hotel is complemented by a detached leisure centre—complete with pool and gym—housed in a charming, single-storey timber-framed and timber-clad cabin located on the western boundary of the property.
The hotel stands on a site of approximately 3.483 hectares / 8.61 acres.
The Kilcoran Lodge Hotel is superbly situated in Ireland’s southern midlands, just off the M8 Dublin to Cork Motorway. The property occupies a prominent position north of the R639 regional road, approximately 9km west of Cahir, 29km west of Clonmel, 30km south of Tipperary Town, and 24km south of Cashel.
Cahir itself is a charming heritage town set on the River Suir, renowned for its historical ties to the Butlers of Ormond. The town benefits from exceptional transport connectivity, located on the Limerick–Waterford Transport and Economic Network, with direct access to Limerick, Waterford, Cork, and Dublin via the M8 motorway and national rail services.
The wider Cahir area is a well-established tourism hub, celebrated for its rich heritage and close proximity to Cashel and the Suir Blueway. Notable attractions nearby include Cahir Castle, the Swiss Cottage, the Rock of Cashel, and Mitchelstown Caves. Cahir is currently undergoing strategic regeneration, with funding secured under the RRDF to revitalise the town centre and historic square as a vibrant Living-Working Quarter. The town also maintains strong links with the agri-food sector, hosting major employers such as ABP Food Group and Oakpark Food.
Future growth in Cahir is set to be driven by its tourism and heritage appeal, with strong associations to Fáilte Ireland’s ‘Ireland’s Ancient East’, Cashel, Munster Vales, and the Suir Blueway. There is also significant potential for expansion in the agri-food manufacturing sector, supported by the town’s strategic location and robust infrastructure.",,8.61,E21 H680,['https://lisney.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/3faa26a0523cf1b4dc02261f8f6e4a7c-0825-kilcoran-lodge-hotel.pdf'],Lisney,,,,,,,,For Sale,2026-02-20,New

PROJECT CARLOW 2040
Project Carlow 2040 is a 20-year strategy aimed at revitalising Carlow Town’s urban environment, economy, and infrastructure. Backed by €23 million in Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) investment, the initiative includes major public realm and connectivity upgrades, many of which are set for completion in 2025. For the Hadden’s Centre, these works will bring direct benefits through enhanced paving, lighting, and pedestrian infrastructure along Tullow Street, significantly improving accessibility and appeal. New pedestrian links connecting Barrack Street, the Potato Market, and the train station will further increase footfall and visibility, reintegrating the Centre into a rejuvenated and more vibrant town core.

Dual access from both Tullow Street & Kennedy Avenue.
Situated within the core area of the Project Carlow 2040 regeneration strategy.
Prominent position with high visibility and strong footfall, enhanced by Penneys on Kennedy Avenue.
Vacant accommodation offers strong potential for asset management, value enhancement, and attracting new occupiers.
Existing tenants — including Paddy Power, Regatta, and a café — provide income from short-term flexible arrangements while maintaining customer footfall.
Total floor area: approx. 2,480.91 sqm / 26,695 sq ft GIA – part occupied, but will be largely vacant, offering immediate asset management potential.
Current annual income from short term flexible arrangements: approx €208,000
Situated in the heart of Carlow Town, this landmark property enjoys dual access from Tullow Street, the town's main retail thoroughfare, and Kennedy Avenue, a key access route. The area experiences high footfall and is surrounded by national and local retailers, educational institutions, and public amenities.

Together, they cover a total area of
449 hectares, of which nearly 90% is productive forest land. The remaining area comprises open bog, lakeshore, roads, and unplanted sections. Sitka spruce is the dominant tree species, accounting for 75% of the forest cover. Ash makes up 9%, while the rest includes a mix of mostly hardwood
species such as oak, alder, and sycamore. The ash stands are supported under the reconstitution scheme. In terms of forest age structure, around 10% of the land is unplanted, while 12% comprises recently reforested areas—mainly Sitka spruce—following clearfelling in 2023 and 2024. Additionally, 22% is classified as young plantations, including approximately 6 hectares of poplar at Glenagross. About 33% of the forests are semi-mature, ranging between 10 to 20 years old, though some areas have lower yield potential. Mature forests ready for immediate harvest make up 22% of the land, with felling licences already secured for some areas.

The Eagle House occupies a prominent corner trading position at the junction of Kilmacud Road Upper, Sandyford Road and Main Street at the centre of Dundrum Village opposite the renowned Dundrum Town Centre shopping centre.
The immediate area has benefitted from recent local authority investment in traffic re-routing and instillation of widened pedestrian pathways coupled with integration of cycle lanes together with the creation of a one-way vehicular traffic route along the lower Sandyford Road section thereby making the immediate area surrounding these licensed premises more pedestrian friendly.

South Dublin, nestled at the foot of the Three Rock Mountain. It is situated approximately 12.5 km south of Dublin City Centre, 11.6 km southwest of Dun Laoghaire, and 11.4 km northwest of Bray.
Over the past decade, Stepaside has experienced significant growth, transitioning from a traditional village to a bustling suburban area. The development of new residential housing estates and village apartments has greatly increased the local population. The area is further enriched by its proximity to established suburbs such as Dundrum, Sandyford, Stillorgan, Leopardstown, Foxrock, Carrickmines, and Kilternan.
This rapid residential expansion, coupled with Stepaside’s close proximity to Dublin City Centre, has solidified its reputation as a desirable residential district in South County Dublin. Adding to its appeal is the nearby Cherrywood, South Dublin’s most rapidly developing district. Covering a 360-hectare Strategic Development Zone (SDZ), Cherrywood will feature over 8,700 residential units due for completion by 2028. The Step Inn, located just 9 km from Cherrywood, stands out as a key destination, especially since Cherrywood currently has no licensed premises within its immediate vicinity.
The area is well-connected by public transportation, with several frequent bus routes and the nearby LUAS Green Line stop at Ballyogan, offering direct access to the southeastern suburbs and Dublin City Centre. Additionally, the district benefits from its proximity to the M50 Motorway, which provides convenient access to Dublin Airport, as well as northern, western, and southern Dublin, and other parts of the country.
Stepaside also boasts a variety of local attractions, including the Stepaside Public Golf Course, the Stepaside Driving Range and Pitch & Putt course, and the Ski Club Ireland facilities at Kilternan. The Samuel Beckett Civic Campus in Ballyogan has further enhanced the area, offering numerous community and sporting amenities, such as a multi-sport facility, gymnasium, swimming pool, skate park, and games pitches.",,,D18 F248,[],Lisney,,,,,,,,For Sale,2026-02-20,New

Strategically positioned, Peter’s Pub is 180 meters west of Grafton Street, 400 meters south of Temple Bar’s cultural and entertainment Quarter, 240 meters east of South Great George’s Street, and 500 meters north of Wexford Street trading district.

Standing proudly on an elevated site overlooking Killiney Bay to Sorrento Terrace and Bray Head, Mount Mapas House holds the distinction of being the first house constructed on Victoria Road at the junction with the now iconic Vico Road. Predating both Mount Eagle (c.1838) and Victoria Castle (c.1840), it marks the beginning of architectural development in this distinguished part of Killiney.
Its location and design are a true testament to the ambition and vision of its original builders. The house sits upon a remarkable man-made platform, a major engineering achievement of its time, supported by a battered granite retaining wall rising to a height of 8 metres. This imposing wall remains a defining visual feature of Vico Road today, especially at its junction with Victoria Road.
Although the precise date of its construction remains unconfirmed, it is widely believed that Thomas Bourchier, a resident of nearby Killiney Castle, built Mount Mapas House shortly after acquiring the Mount Mapas estate around 1797. The house’s original footprint remains largely unchanged, preserving its historic form and character.
The structure itself is a fine example of an early 19th-century villa with a graceful ironwork veranda at first floor level that lends it a distinctly colonial elegance. The level terrace on which it stands not only facilitated the house’s construction but also provided practical garden and driveway space for carriages — a rarity in such a steep, coastal setting.
In 1834, the estate was acquired by Robert Warren, a notable figure in the area’s development who commenced a series of speculative residential projects starting with Mount Eagle, followed closely by Victoria Castle. These properties were often made available for seasonal rental, reflecting both the allure and exclusivity of Killiney during this period.
From 1872 to 1879, Mount Mapas was home to William Colles, a prominent Dublin surgeon, and later his son, Graves Chamney Colles. In 1879, it was sold to Murrough John O’Brien, a distinguished civil servant, who made the house his family residence for over 15 years.
The property was subsequently rented by notable figures including Rt. Hon. C.T. Reddington and W. Patterson, manager of the Daily Irish Independent. Such tenancies underscore the house’s long-standing appeal to prominent professionals and public figures.
Nestled along the prestigious Victoria Road, Mount Mapas House is positioned for privacy and accessibility. Just a short stroll from Killiney Village, the beach, and scenic hill walks, it enjoys one of Dublin’s most beautiful natural settings. Close proximity to Dalkey Heritage Town offers a vibrant mix of artisan shops, cafés, pubs, and some of South Dublin’s finest restaurants.
Killiney’s Crown Jewel – A Georgian Masterpiece Overlooking the Sea – Where History Meets Horizon
Step into timeless grandeur with Mount Mapas House, an extraordinary Georgian period residence of rare distinction, commanding an elevated position above Killiney Bay. One of the finest homes to come to market in 2025, this magnificent double-fronted detached property is set amidst 1.25 acres of meticulously landscaped gardens, with spectacular panoramic views stretching from Dalkey Island and Sorrento Terrace to the rugged cliffs of Bray Head.
Extending to approximately 585 sq.m (6,300 sq.ft), Mount Mapas House is a rare combination of stately architectural heritage and refined contemporary luxury, nestled on what is arguably Killiney’s most prestigious road.
From the moment you pass through the tall, electric wrought iron gates, a sense of exclusivity and grace is unmistakable. A sweeping gravelled driveway, framed by manicured hedging and mature planting, offers extensive off-street parking. Granite steps lead to a classic wrought iron veranda, framing the stately entrance of this double-fronted Georgian home and hinting at the elegance within.
Inside, the home opens with a generously proportioned reception hall, a statement of arrival in itself. Off this, the Drawing Room and Dining Room—the principal reception spaces—stand proudly to the front, each one offering expansive views over the shimmering waters of the bay. High ceilings, original fireplaces, ornate cornicing, and oversized sash windows showcase the timeless craftsmanship of this historic residence.
A few steps below the dining room, a cosy snug provides a more intimate family space. The split-level stairwell, illuminated by a magnificent cathedral-style skylight, leads to the upper floor where four beautifully appointed double bedrooms await. The main suite boasts a corner bay window seat, inviting quiet moments of reflection while taking in the serene sea views. Two of the bedrooms feature luxurious en suite bathrooms, while a refined home study completes the upper level.
The garden level delivers an unparalleled standard of family living. A second sitting room, mirroring the main bedroom above, includes matching bay windows and opens through double folding doors to an elegant sunroom—a glass-wrapped sanctuary with views on three sides. Beyond lies the kitchen/breakfast room, thoughtfully designed for both practicality and entertaining, with access to the private rear courtyard and additional secure resident parking.
Additional accommodation on this level includes two further double bedrooms (one with en suite), a family bathroom with sauna, a plant room, and an additional reception room offering exceptional versatility—be it for leisure, fitness, or media.
The gardens at Mount Mapas House are nothing short of a botanical masterpiece—flat, private, and bursting with colour and life, yet elegantly curated for year-round enjoyment. A charming pedestrian gate to the side leads to lower tiered gardens, with wrought iron access across Vico Road to a secluded coastal haven.
Here, you’ll find an al fresco dining terrace with a fully equipped outdoor kitchen, toilet facilities, garden store, and a feature water fountain—all overlooking Killiney Beach below. From here, direct access to the beach provides a rare and remarkable amenity, elevating the lifestyle offered by this singular residence.
Perfectly positioned just off Killiney Hill Road, Mount Mapas House is within walking distance of Killiney village, Killiney Hill Park, and a short drive from Dalkey’s thriving town centre, filled with boutique shops, gourmet restaurants, and cultural attractions.
Some of Ireland’s most prestigious schools are within easy reach, including Holy Child Killiney, Loreto Dalkey, Castle Park, and Rathdown Co-Ed School. Transport links are exceptional, with Killiney and Dalkey DART stations close by, multiple bus routes servicing the area, and swift access to the M50 and N11, placing Dublin City Centre just 14km away.
Mount Mapas House is not merely a residence—it is a legacy. A home that offers stately elegance, modern comfort, unmatched views, and a prestigious address. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to own a coastal Georgian masterpiece in one of Ireland’s most sought-after locations.

A quite exceptional contemporary home nestled within some 60 acres, majestically positioned overlooking Dunmore Bay and including a private island. 3 reception rooms, 4 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms and an indoor pool.
Panoramic sea views extend to Loop Head Lighthouse and across the bay to Kerry Head and the Slieve Mish Mountains. Pleasantly remote privacy is paramount and the views uninterrupted. Twilight and evening vistas are quite striking, benefitting from such a unique waterfront position. A land bridge links the island and there is a small beach within the private bay.
Built to exacting standards at great expense, the juxtaposition fusion of such striking architecture and design against such a wild and undisturbed position is extraordinary. Achieving building consent in such a position is exceedingly unique and an increasingly unlikely feat. The purposeful contemporary exterior design is remarkably fused with classical architectural influence within the interior.
The classical design of ornately decorative ceiling cornices replete with gold gilding, a well-executed cantilever stone staircase with elegantly brass coated balustrades and the incorporation of original and exquisite Bossi chimneypieces blended with clean contemporary architectural design to present a truly unique and interesting home. The effect of such design fusion and the incredible rustic West of Ireland position is intoxicating and increasingly compelling with familiarity.
A marked helicopter pad allows air access in addition to both sea and road access from a gravelled laneway off the public road. Nearby Kilbaha Bay Harbour is just a 5 min-drive and has deep water mooring, two pubs and a restaurant. Attractive Carrigaholt village [17-min drive] also has a harbour and village amenities, while the bustling towns of Kilkee and Kilrush are each about a 30-min drive. By boat Carrigaholt and Ballybunion, in Kerry across the bay, can be readily accessed. For air access both Farranfore Airport is nearby and Shannon International Airport easily accessible.
From the gravelled laneway electric security gates lead along a tarmacadam asphalt drive through an inner electric barrier gate into a secure parking courtyard, with integral garaging. A pillared portico leads to the front door and entrance foyer, which leads to a pleasant oval shaped reception hall. This leads to the stair hall, a cloakroom with WC and the magnificent reception room, a spectacular room designed in the Great Room tradition. It occupies the entire south facing coastal front elevation and includes living, dining and kitchen spaces. East and west patio spaces, to either end, link seamlessly. The stair hall extends over three floors and features a remarkable cantilever stone staircase and accesses a glass elevator lift.
A study on the upper floor accesses a large roof terrace and links to the rooftop reception room, both having glorious ocean views. The pool room on the lower level opens out onto a large patio terrace and is augmented by a luxurious ‘Champagne Room’ and changing rooms. The master bedroom suite is on the ground floor and has magnificent sea views, a superb walk-in wardrobe and ensuite shower room. Two further bedroom suites on the lower floor open onto patio terraces and are augmented by a private guest bedroom suite within the enclosed courtyard. It has a bedroom, shower room and kitchenette and framed sea views through a picture window within the courtyard brick wall.
The courtyard can be accessed directly from the house, the south patio terrace or the parking courtyard. It includes a delightful curve-fronted garden room, a lily pond and rose beds. The integral garaging can accommodate up to four cars and link to a fuel store and into the axial hall linking to the stair hall, elevator lift and kitchen. An adjacent room to the kitchen serves as a laundry and back kitchen.

There are wonderful period details throughout a testament to the workmanship of the era of construction.
To the rear of the original residence, a modern purpose-built care facility was constructed which now provides extensive bedroom and ancillary living accommodation in addition to the main residence.
The elegance and grandeur of the original residence remains and with vision and foresight, could be re-converted into a truly wonderful private residence enjoying one of the finest private gardens in Dublin 6.

The house is presented in superb condition and is simply magical, the symmetrical five-bay original Georgian house wonderfully augmented by the 19th-century castellated tower and battlemented parapet walls to create a beautifully attractive and fun house.
The accommodation is well laid out and updated to readily allow comfortable living, seamlessly incorporating modern convenience whilst retaining fantastic historical character. The reception rooms are impressive with large windows and generous ceiling heights and link excellently to allow superb entertaining yet are each of a scale to be comfortable. The generous kitchen with the wonderfully large table is a great space and superbly designed to allow congenial informal gathering for family and guests. There are ample bedroom suites, and the first-floor sunroom conservatory is exceptional.
The original L-Shaped Stable yard has been carefully upgraded and features a modern self-contained 3 Bedroom Caretakers residence, 3 well appointed loose boxes and an abundance of overhead lofted storage – itself ripe for further conversion if desired. This Ivy-clad local cut stone finish allows the building to blend seamlessly into the castellated surroundings with a traditional stone archway highlighting its period features.
The gardens and grounds are glorious. Extremely private and sheltered but with excellent sea views still afforded. A blend of formal terraces and manicured lawns within the immediate gardens into less formal gardens and the wider parkland works superbly. The use of manicured pathways throughout the parkland working extremely well to seamlessly link the gardens to the wider lands and providing highly useable walks. The outer coastal lands very much connect the estate to the sea and provide some lovely private coves and beaches. Coolmain beach is noted for its pristine powdery sand. Overall, the various component parts of the estate all combine to present a truly magical and attractive circa 56-acre estate.
Coolmain Castle has a rich and magical provenance and has been home to the Disney family for the past 35-years. Purchased by Roy E. Disney, nephew of Walt Disney and vice-charman of the Walt Disney Company, in 1989 and comprehensively restored and updated Coolmain Castle has been meticulously maintained ever since. Notable owners before the Disney’s have included The Honourable Henry Boyle Bernard, Thomas Wyse, Hibernicus Scott, the novelist Donn Byrne, photographer Bob Willougby ‘the man who virtually invented the photojournalistic motion picture still’ and most recently and fittingly the Disney family.
Dating to the early 18th-century a magical fusion of various additions and amendments in keeping with changing architectural fashions over the preceding centuries presents a wonderfully textured and layered architecture that combined with the gloriously coloured local stone walls and being positioned in an extremely picturesque location, set overlooking the sea, makes Coolmain Castle truly authentic and attractive.
Positioned in the scenic and vibrant southwest of Ireland many thriving and bustling nearby coastal towns include popular Kinsale, a popular historic sailing town with a wide selection of fine restaurants, a deep-water harbour and the famed Old Head golf links. Walking trails, golfing and sailing amenity is in abundance. Cork city is within easy reach, just 27-miles or 44-km away and Cork International airport less than a 30-minute drive.
The castle is available fully furnished and with garden tools and equipment included.

The accommodation is grand and beautifully executed, with the principal house comprising 14,235 square feet (1,322 sq. metres) and including 5 principal reception rooms and 10 bedrooms.

The stone outbuildings comprise 9,158 square feet or 851 sq. metres.
Built in 1745, to a design attributed to the renowned architect Francis Bindon, Sopwell Hall is impressive yet welcoming and conforms to the best traditions of early Georgian architecture. The house stands three storeys over basement with direct access from the ground and basement levels. The magnificent reception hall, lined with distinctive fluted Doric pilasters and divided by a screen of arches, is spacious and well-proportioned. A morning room, study, drawing room and dining room are each impressive. Displaying the very best features and proportions of fine Georgian architecture each is filled with natural light, has impressive large marble chimneypieces with open fires and ornate cornicing. A feature of the entire house is the abundance of natural light with ample tall and large glazed windows. The lower level includes a sitting room or den, a large kitchen, wine cellar, laundry and staff apartment. A broad carved staircase leads to a generously large landing on the main bedroom floor. Impressive architecturally, there are six matching scagliola sienna marble columns and a large, perfectly proportioned domed ceiling, with a glazed atrium. There are 5 principal bedrooms and 4 bathrooms on this floor. The Master Bedroom Suite occupies the south-eastern corner. The second floor provides 5 further bedrooms and a bathroom and has a games room and study. A Studio, positioned in the adjacent courtyard, comprises some 660 square feet or 61 square metres.
The estate is a haven of tranquillity and privacy that is rare in the 21st-century. Positioned at the end of a half-mile drive Sopwell Hall occupies a central position within its own estate and enjoys a panoramic view over the park and woodland. The outer parts of the estate comprising a perimeter woodland belt and creating a great sense of privacy and seclusion. Among the many ancient and specimen trees throughout the estate are some particularly fine Spanish chestnut, a noted ancient beech wood and a rare Siberian crab-apple tree. The woodlands include indigenous oak, beech, ash, larch and spruce. All through the year there is a kaleidoscope of colour throughout the estate. There is, too, much wildlife to be found on the estate. Red squirrels, pine martens, foxes and hares are regularly sighted, and buzzards, owls and falcons can also be found. The Coillte forestry, circa 500 acres, which adjoins the estate provides great amenity with access to long walking trails in beautiful surroundings. Of the circa 240-acres or 97 hectares within the estate about 100-acres is in woodland. Additional circa 60-acres grassland available.

Thulla on Dunbo Hill in Howth is a small enclave of exclusive properties in the heart of Howth Village, No 1 must be seen to be believed. It is over 7,000 sqft of the most elegant, refined accommodation. The property is laid out over three floors with an interior design which is both stylish and sophisticated with modern comforts beyond extraordinary. The property is situated behind electric gates in and is both private and secure in an extremely convenient location. The setting provides an atmosphere that is both quiet and serene whilst the layout and design overlooking the harbour connects the residence with the activity below creating a really beautiful and ever-changing vista. The accommodation includes 5 bedrooms all ensuite, an abundance of open plan living space at hall level whilst a ground floor level there is a cinema room, temperature-controlled wine cellar, fully equipped home gym, a Norwegian sauna and outdoor stainless-steel hot-tub, steam rooms and luxurious home office. There is ample secure parking for 4/5 cars, a private rear garden trimmed by a herringbone limestone path and flanked by mature olive trees overlooking the west pier of the harbour. Every inch of this spectacular home has been carefully considered, every door handled consciously selected to complement its surroundings and is more akin to a five-star boutique hotel than a 5-bedroom home in one of Dublin’s most exclusive locations, all overlooking Howth Harbour and Ireland’s Eye beyond.
The views from all three levels are equally exquisite and endlessly interesting. Somehow the vista is both serenely peaceful and at times a plethora of colour and activity. The landscape is ever changing from sunrise to the east, throughout the day to the most beautiful sunsets Dublin has to offer and later, in the evening as the harbour lights up below on the West Pier. The property was at first designed and then enhanced to make the most of these breathtaking views. As you enter this five-star home the tone is set to ‘Premium’ immediately. There is a stunning herringbone solid oak hardwood floor throughout the bright, spacious, welcoming hallway. As you traverse the hall to the reception rooms beyond, your eye is instantly drawn through glass double doors where Irelands eye in the distance is framed by the picture-window in the living room. The main living room and the kitchen / dining room are seamlessly connected and have an open plan layout whilst each space is very clearly defined. The kitchen / dining room runs the full length of the property and could only be described as opulent. Designed to make the most of the views over the harbour the kitchen has six metre long island unit as the focal point with a marble countertop and teak breakfast bar, with integrated appliances an induction hob and extractor hood overhead, a kitchen fit to host the most lavish dinner parties. The many features of this impressive kitchen include integrated ‘Gaggenau’ appliances, an air conditioned larder, a full height wine fridge along with a UV light neatly disguised over the generous countertop to encourage a small indoor herb garden. The bespoke kitchen units are crossed grain, dark oak panels with solid bronze handles which are at first glance understated but up close really quite elegant, separating the kitchen and dining room there is a beautiful, back lit ‘Crittal’ glass display cabinet. There is ample space to entertain or dine formally in the dining room at one end of the kitchen and at the other three large glass panel, concertina doors draw back to connect this space to the large patio / terrace ideal for dining outdoors any time of the year. The living room is equally impressive with two floor to ceiling picture windows either side of a feature gas fire, ‘Bang and Olufsen’ TV inset and a curved, tiled fire surround.
At ground floor level there are several features of this distinctive residence that really set it apart from almost anything else available on the market today. There are two bedroom suites complete with luxurious ensuite bathrooms fully tiled with rainfall, steam-room showers in both. Each room also enjoys the benefit of direct access through sliding doors to a private south facing terrace. From back to front a neat hallway connects the bedroom suites to the gym, spa, cinema utility and study beyond. On route you will encounter a wine cellar which is beautifully crafted from solid white oak and marble, back lit and plumbed behind Crittal doors, a work of art in itself, a cellar which would be suitable for the finest of fine wine collections. There are double doors here which open to reveal a home gym that can cater for the whole family at the same time. The view once again begins to come back into focus with a small hallway behind glass doors between your daily work out and a ‘Gessi’ outdoor shower, a ‘Brass Monkey’ ice bath and the stainless steel hot tub on the deck overlooking Ireland’s Eye, yet completely hidden from view. The Gymnasium together with the large Norwegian Sauna and outdoor amenities on the deck create a fairly unique outdoor / indoor wellness spa which can be enjoyed at any time of the year in complete privacy all with breathtaking views.
On the other side of the hall is a study which feels slightly removed from the rest of the home and is yet still connected and cosy. This space provides for a peaceful retreat ideal for rest and relaxation or alternatively to will afford the new owners with a quiet space to focus while working from home. The flooring is for the most part wooden herringbone but at ground floor level it is white ash instead of oak which adds to the brightness throughout. Beside the study there is a large fully fitted cinema room complete with multi-tiered sofa beds, again with enough room to host the whole family or a small birthday party. The utility and storage room are fitted with top of the range ‘Gaggeneau’ appliances to complete the accommodation a ground floor level. Even whilst doing the laundry one can enjoy the scenery as far as the Mountains of Mourne on a clear day.
On the first floor there are three more bedrooms and a laundry closet. Two of the bedrooms are double rooms both ensuite with walk in wardrobes and a designated study space. These two rooms also benefit from an elevated position and a view toward the lush green hills of the ‘Ben of Howth’ to the South. The main bedroom truly is the jewel in this crown. The dressing room comes complete with a bespoke, cushioned wardrobe and vanity unit with a glass display case for your jewellery along with a his and hers walk in wardrobe. The ensuite bathroom would not be out of place in any of the finest hotels in the country. There is a view in the mirror whilst brushing your teeth in the morning of Irelands Eye and Lambay Island in the distance. The bath has an overflow which creates an infinity pool effect with a separate double shower where you can enjoy the views as far the horizon at sunrise. The bedroom itself has a split level lay out where you step down to the bedroom. There is additional wardrobe space here (just in case) and the bed is perfectly positioned to give complete privacy but also offers a discreet view of the harbour from where you could watch the world go by with a coffee on a lazy Sunday morning. The upper level has a fully fitted study desk and two armchairs placed right in front of the floor to ceiling corner window, if No 1 Thulla was to compete for the ‘House of the Year’ this would the where the owners would put the famous red spot. An idyllic setting to take in the view, particularly as the sun goes down on the day and the harbour lights up.
Howth has long been home to the rich and famous, but Thulla offers something the most salubrious locations in Dublin simply cannot match. Opulence, elegance and abundant floor space, every conceivable modern comfort, unrivalled views from almost every room all right in the heart of Howth Village. Google maps indicates the DART station is just an 8-minute walk door to door. All of the eateries and amenities that make the Peninsula endlessly popular are quite literally right on your doorstep. The journey to the city is 20km and just 30 mins on the DART. You can be at home in bed in 30 minutes once you collect your bag in Dublin Airport just 17km away.

A magnificent, detached family home constructed in 1994 over three levels with solid concrete floors occupying an elevated position on beautiful sloping south westerly facing gardens and woodland with mature native and exotic trees that extends to approximately 0.5 Ha (1.25 acres) boasting spectacular sea views over Dublin Bay from Dalkey Island and across to Howth.
Located on Mount Salus Road, a private road behind an imposing pillar and gate entrance accessed off Knocknacree Road, the property has direct gated pedestrian access to the popular scenic walks over Dalkey/Killiney hills, and is within walking distance of the wonderful amenities and facilities in Dalkey Town Centre including its own DART station as well as an excellent selection of highly regarded primary and secondary schools and a host of sporting, recreation and leisure facilities.
The house was jointly designed by David Crowley of Cantwell Crowley Architects and New Hampshire Architect Dennis Mires. Its open plan living area design and style has a very American feel to it. Every single room has a sea view and is back-lit with natural light from the rear’s sunny south-westerly orientation.
The property is approached through a modern pillared entrance onto a gravelled driveway with off street parking for numerous cars. Black limestone steps lead up to a Tom de Paor Architect designed twin height porched entrance addition. Off the entrance hall to the right there is a bright and airy open plan Poggenpohl kitchen/breakfast room that in turn opens into a sunny family room on one side and a bow shaped dining room on the other with breath- taking sea views from a bay of six full height windows. A spacious sitting room and gorgeous octagonal home office/library completes the accommodation at this level. An open steel and maple wood thread stairwell divides in two up to a light infused first floor landing. Off the landing there is a family bathroom and three excellent double bedrooms all en suite with spectacular sea views. The master bedroom has a cathedral style high ceiling, a balcony, walk in closet and large en suite bathroom.
At garden level there is a kitchen/living/dining room with two double en suite bedrooms, a guest w.c., store and wine cellar. As this area has its own entrance door and kitchen, it can easily be separated from the main house as a self-contained unit if needs be for a family member or visiting friends.
The landscaped gardens and especially the woodland area are a particular feature of the property and wraparound the property perfectly. The woodland area, laid out in the early 20th Century, has been lovingly restored with the addition of granite step paths, terraced vegetable garden, mortar free granite walls and dozens of native and exotic tree species. It is enclosed to the rear and side by a high granite wall. Its labyrinth of paths provides endless enjoyment and is a child’s haven where they can safely play and explore to their hearts content. The elevated sea views are quite simply breath-taking, and the quality of construction utilised the best materials available on the market including imported ‘Andersen’ windows. The house has a concrete construction – ring beams and poured concrete floors – making it an exceptionally solid, low maintenance, home from top to bottom.
The location of this attractive family home will be of major interest to those trying to get a foothold in the hugely popular and desirable suburb of Dalkey with its superb amenities, excellent schools, churches, pubs, some of South County Dublin’s finest restaurants, bus services and DART station. The Aircoach to Dublin Airport runs from Fitzpatrick’s Castle and Hyde Road hourly. Leisure and recreational facilities couldn’t be better with pleasant direct access to miles of public park walks over Killiney and Dalkey hills as well as along the seafront. There are excellent recreational facilities including GAA, golf and tennis clubs close by. The four yacht clubs at Dun Laoghaire Harbour with its extensive marina will be of major interest to the marine and sailing enthusiast.

A most impressive Edwardian red brick period property wonderfully located on this special tree lined road, in the heart of Dublin 6. Benefiting from a highly sought after location being only a short walk from Palmerston Park and Dunville Avenue. This wonderful home offers practical and generous family orientated accommodation of approximately 344sqm (3703 sqft). Complemented by truly delightful lawned and planted gardens and also offers generous gated off-street parking. Glenthorne which has been in the same family for 70 years, with only two owners and guardians to date, it really is a truly special property for any discerning buyer to secure their forever family home.
Approached by a gated entrance, this wonderful ivy clad home is well set back from the road, screened with mature planting and offering ample parking for multiple cars on a low maintenance pebble driveway. This impressive family home stands on approximately 0.3 acres of beautifully landscaped gardens to front and rear. Entered through a truly magnificent reception hall, laden with rich period detail characteristic of the era. The very practical layout of this home offers wonderful and generous accommodation. At hall level there are two very impressive reception rooms, ideal for hosting gatherings and entertaining or perfectly suited for day-to-day use. These elegant rooms of generous proportions all feature the characteristic period details found in homes of this era, flooded with natural light from the generous windows throughout. A small flight of stairs leads down to the family room, the kitchen and the working part of the house to include a pantry, utility and downstairs toilet facilities. On the first floor there are four superb bedrooms with the main bedroom located to the front. This room features a bay window and benefits from ensuite shower facilities. A family bathroom and walk-in hot press complete the accommodation at this level. A further fight of stairs leads to the very top of the house part of the original footprint of the house, where there are two further bedrooms with fireplaces and picture windows. An important selling feature of this magnificent property is the delightful rear garden of approximately 130 ft, which has been lovingly created and is stocked with a wonderful array of mature shrubs & trees. The property is further enhanced by a large garage and gated side access. The hen house and glass house are a nod to a by gone era, a time when hens roamed freely and home grown vegetable and fruit were the norm.

“Limitless and immortal, the waters are the beginning and end of all things on earth.” — Heinrich Zimmer
Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty are delighted to present for sale a site of approximately 1.2 hectares with full planning permission for a one off residence of over 11,500sqft in a unique hillside setting with unparallelled views of Dublin Bay and a beautiful sunny south facing aspect. There are only a select number of residential properties anywhere in Dublin with a sea view, a southerly aspect and direct access to the shoreline. There are only eight that share the unparalleled view, enviable position and impressive scale that ‘The End’ enjoys on the peninsula of Howth and as a result this type of opportunity arises perhaps, just once in a generation.
The current owners have gone to great lengths to secure full planning permission for a home that would not be out of place overlooking the bay of Monte Carlo or along the LA Coastline. The existing planning could easily be re-imagined or just tailored slightly to suit the requirements of the most ambitious hopes, plans and dreams of the new owners.
The access from Carrickbrack Road meanders along a driveway which chicanes down to the existing property below. The current plans include the demolition of the house which currently sits at the centre of the 2 acre site. At this level there is a long, wide plateau where the hall level will be positioned in the new building. The current drawings were drafted to maximise the jaw dropping views across the bay to the south city and the Dublin mountains beyond. The site is surrounded by mature trees which contribute to the privacy and also protect the grounds and gardens from the elements.
The vision for the new residence which has been designed by Douglas Wallace architects and inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright’s Prairie House, has provision to cater for the needs of the most luxurious and adventurous lifestyles in the most serene setting. At hall level there is both a lobby and grand hall with a sweeping staircase, a library, drawing room, art gallery, orangery, a snug, a study and a boot room. The kitchen, dining room are positioned centrally and face Dublin Bay either side of an Alpine room designed around a double height chimney breast with ‘wow’ views in every direction. There are a selection of sunlight terraces and an outdoor heated pool included in the plans which will appeal those who may want to create a unique, luxurious, private place to retreat whilst also facilitating those who enjoy entertaining friends and family in the most impressive setting Ireland has to offer.
At ‘ground floor’ level there is a large multi car garage complete with turntable, a cinema, gym, wine cellar and a guest suite or staff accommodation. The bedroom accommodation on the first floor allows for 4 large suites each with their own walk-in wardrobes and bathrooms. The Master suite will have his & hers dressing rooms and the option of separate bathrooms, incredible views to the south and a private terrace complete with outdoor showers.
Planning will allow for a multi car garage at the entrance and a car lift which will bring you to the door of the main house and a remodelling of the existing driveway to both increase the width and soften the slope.
The appeal of this project will undoubtedly extend beyond the shores of this Island and if your ambition is to create your dream home on the coastline anywhere in the world it would be difficult to find one quite as spectacular. It is indescribably picturesque, private, quite and remote yet on the doorstep of the City just 21km from St Stephens Green and 18km from Dublin Airport.
Howth is a seaside town often referred to as the ‘green lung’ of Dublin City protected by a special area amenity order with 16km of coastline around the peninsula, a selection of stunning beaches and a marina in the harbour for those who enjoy the sea in their spare time. Some of the countrys best golf courses including Old Portmarnock, The Island and Royal Dublin are just a few minutes away with a wide selection of excellent restaurants and boutique cafes in the village and the DART line which makes the short journey to the city centre quick and easy.
Known as ‘The End’ and situated on the cliff’s edge on the Peninsula of Howth, this site truly is “the end and the beginning” for someone who wants to create the home of their dreams in the most idyllic setting this Ireland has to offer.",2002.085,2.0,D13P603,[],Lisney,,,,,,,,For Sale,2026-02-20,New

I Love You and television series including Camelot, The Tudors and Vikings.

th
century medieval style home magically positioned within verdant countryside, just a 30-minute drive from Dublin, and enjoying elevated views to the Irish Sea. In all some 11 acres or 4.45 hectares of private grounds, including stables and paddocks.
Built
circa
1865 in the medieval revival style as part of the extensive Glanmore Estate. Glanmore was the family home of the famous playwright, John Millington Synge. His most famous plays include
The Playboy of the Western World
and
Riders of the Sea
. Seamus Heaney, the Nobel Laureate poet, lived next door. Glanmore Hall has quite a cinematic provenance with various movie stars, including Julia Roberts, making Glanmore Hall their home while filming in Ireland.
Located in a beautiful part of county Wicklow the scenery around Glanmore Hall is remarkable with the sea and mountains framing verdant undulating countryside. Pleasantly and privately positioned within manicured grounds the vistas from the house are quite remarkable, with commanding views over rolling countryside to the Irish Sea. The accommodation at Glanmore Hall is bright and the rooms spacious with high ceilings. The breath-taking banqueting hall with wonderful Gothic style medieval windows, a double height ceiling and a Minstrels gallery is simply magnificent. The Minstrels gallery is used as a study. The family room and dining room each have fireplaces with stoves. The kitchen is well fitted, and links to an enclosed private garden. There are 4 bedrooms. The master bedroom suite includes a bedroom, two walk-in wardrobes and a bathroom. A second bedroom suite has a shower room and the 2 other bedrooms share a shower room, which has a feature stained glass window.
The medieval architecture is augmented by Gothic interior joinery. Glanmore Hall is an attractive and comfortable historic home. Extensively renovated in 1993 and upgraded in 2016. There is the added benefit of FTTH fibre optic broadband.
Accessed securely from within the Glanmore Estate the grounds are extremely picturesque. The attractively coloured stone of the house and garden walls resting easily into the verdant landscape. Mature woodland rising on the hill behind forming a stunning backdrop. Although ruinous a large courtyard with an extensive range of stone buildings is extremely attractive and could be restored or possibly converted to provided additional accommodation.
A south and west facing enclosed garden to the rear of the house is a superb entertaining space. A large open veranda links directly to the dining room and kitchen and has a brick chimney with an open fire. The lands are in two paddocks and there are 2 stables. There is direct access into the adjacent Devils’ Glen woods, a vast
2,000 acre national woodland park. Picturesque walks include one along the Vartry river to the waterfall and an abundance of wildlife includes swallows and red kites, with regular sightings from the house. Trail riding, schooling and livery is offered by an adjacent equestrian centre.
Wicklow’s landscape is unique with cliffs, sandy beaches, rolling mountains, hidden lakes, bogs and quaint villages. It offers an abundance of outdoor amenity with numerous walking and cycling trails, links and parkland golf courses, coastal, river and lake fishing.
Dublin is just a 30-minute drive away with St. Stephen’s Green in the city centre about a 45-minute drive. The DART commuter train service can be accessed at Greystones, a 20-minute drive, and the regular rail service from nearby Wicklow town. The village of Ashford provides local shopping and access to the M11 motorway. Its pubs, cafes and restaurants are richly augmented by some celebrated ones in the area.

Glendaars House is an extremely pleasant early 20th-century country house, which benefits from significant upgrading and extending in recent years to present a comfortable 5-bedroom home with a separate 1-bedroom annexe apartment. 5269 square feet or 490 square metres.
Set within circa 4.6-acres (1.86-hectares) of grounds, the gardens are tremendous and with mature trees, shrubs and hedging are extremely private and tranquil. In addition to the original stables there is a well laid-out barn stabling complex with a turn-out area, a post-and-railed arena, paddock grazing and the benefit of access from a second entrance. The Dublin mountains framing the view below the grazing paddocks.
Enjoying a rich and interesting historic provenance Glendaars House dates to circa 1924, when it was first inhabited by Colonel James (Jim) Slattery who was one of Michael Collin’s close confidantes in the Free State Army. One of the ‘Twelve Apostles’ his alias was ‘The One-Handed Assassin’, a hand being lost in military action. Later, Glendaars House was home to Ann Smurfit, who added the drawing room and family room. More recently, circa 2006, Glendaars House benefited from significant upgrading and extension works that remodelled the accommodation layout to provide four-bedroom suites, ample natural light and modern comfort. The guest apartment is independently accessed and has a large open plan kitchen with dining and living spaces, a bedroom and shower room. Adjacent is a large 2 door garage.
A majestic laurel arch entrance with electric security gates leads to a gravelled forecourt in front of the house. A generous reception hall has a chequered tiled floor and cast iron fireplace with an open fire. The family room is dual aspect and has a distinctive exposed beam ceiling, large timber fireplace with an open fire and a large south-west facing bay window. It leads into the study, again dual aspect and with a large bay window, open fireplace, double French doors to outside and linking to the kitchen. The dining room has timber fireplace with an open fire and links to a large games or party room. Spacious it enjoys a triple aspect with large double French doors to a garden terrace, an open fireplace, exposed beamed ceiling and three bay windows. It is an extremely versatile space. The kitchen also enjoys a triple aspect and is a generous open plan living space with kitchen, living and dining spaces. It too has exposed ceiling beams, a fireplace with a wood stove and large double French doors to a garden patio terrace.
Upstairs there is a wonderful master bedroom suite, four further bedrooms suites, a fifth bedroom and a family bathroom. The master suite has a large dual aspect bedroom, an ensuite bathroom with fitted bath and separate shower and a generous walk-in closet and eaves store. The second bedroom suite has an open fireplace, a dressing room and ensuite shower room, while bedrooms suites three and four each have ensuite shower rooms. The fifth bedroom is nearby to the family bathroom, itself positioned just off the stair landing.
The gardens are extremely pleasant with well-placed south and west facing patio terraces linking easily to the house. A children’s play area within a stand of grand old cedar trees is magical and well sheltered. Mature shrubs and trees throughout the gardens ensure rich seasonal colour and include a distinctive red maple tree, oak, chestnut, sycamore, roan, silver birch, cherry blossoms, weeping willow trees and an apple orchard. Mature hedges ensure great shelter and privacy. Box hedging frames manicured lawns.
The location is highly desirable, easily commutable to Dublin city and its international airport (a circa 35-minute drive), yet remarkably extremely tranquil and quiet. Naas town and Sallins (train station) are less than a 10-minute drive, the K-Club just a 5-minute drive and Maynooth town
