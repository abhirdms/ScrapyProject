A remarkable development opportunity, with a very rare opportunity to acquire a landmark mixed use property, within easy walking distance of the Village Centre and close to open Countryside The property has been in the ownership of our client’s family since 1947 and this will be the first time in all of those years that this unique property has been offered for sale. Set in a plot extending to 0.16 acres (approx) and originally a pair of dwellings the property has been modified over the years to create what now exists, effectively a large detached building of some scale, with an internal floor area of approx. 4,000 sq ft. The present layout has a large shop front from where the renowned store, Granthams, currently trades and We feel it would be a straightforward exercise to convert the ground floor commercial element of the building into residential space to follow the accommodation on the upper floors which currently comprises a first floor sitting room and dining room (which could both be bedrooms) in addition to 4 further bedrooms across the first and second floors. Conversely, the whole property could be converted into apartments (subject to PP), or in our view would make a superb Headquarters Building for a local company wishing to base itself within the Community. Outside, there is a large carport and additional outbuildings providing useful storage, whilst there is lovely garden to the side and a private courtyard/patio area to the rear The property is situated on Heyes Lane, accessed off the main London Rd in Alderley Edge.
