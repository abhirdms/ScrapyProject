Camberley is in the Surrey Heath area, 31 miles (50 km) southwest of central London, in the corridor between the M3 and M4 motorways. Surrey Heath's economy is buoyant and unemployment is low.

Manufacturing still plays an important role although the trend is towards office-based services - particularly in the financial sector - and highly-skilled, often blue-chip, occupations.
