Use this folder for each new website before asking for XPath/parsing updates.

Files:
- `listing_page.html`: Save full HTML of the listing/search results page (include pagination block).
- `detail_page_1.html`: Save full HTML of one property detail page linked from listing.
- `detail_page_2.html`: Save a second detail page if layout/fields vary (optional but recommended).

Workflow:
1. Open site page in browser.
2. Save page source into the matching file above.
3. Share website URL + tell me to parse from these local files.

Note:
- Replace these files for each new website.
- Keep all three in sync with the same website.
